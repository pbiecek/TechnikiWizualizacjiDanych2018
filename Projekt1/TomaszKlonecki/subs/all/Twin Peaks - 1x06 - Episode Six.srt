1
00:00:01,447 --> 00:00:03,085
Previously on "Twin Peaks"...

2
00:00:03,207 --> 00:00:06,404
You'll put me to work
behind the perfume counter.

3
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:08,404
Does that clear things up?

4
00:00:08,607 --> 00:00:10,802
So where do I start?

5
00:00:11,247 --> 00:00:13,158
Washing dishes will be fine.

6
00:00:13,327 --> 00:00:16,842
Donna, it's Maddy.
I found a tape in her hiding place.

7
00:00:17,047 --> 00:00:21,245
I'll meet you and James tomorrow,
and bring a tape recorder.

8
00:00:21,367 --> 00:00:25,360
Why would an apartment dweller like
Jacques buy so much heating oil?

9
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:27,006
To heat a log cabin.

10
00:00:27,247 --> 00:00:32,799
- What did you see that night?
- Two men, two girls.

11
00:00:33,047 --> 00:00:34,400
Screams.

12
00:00:38,487 --> 00:00:41,445
We'll give Josie a chance to sell,
tomorrow.

13
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:46,516
You do realise the risk
if anyone sees us.

14
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:49,002
Don't touch me!
Don't come near me, Leo!

15
00:00:52,727 --> 00:00:55,287
Don't make me leave, please.

16
00:00:55,607 --> 00:00:57,643
Don't make me leave.

17
00:02:38,727 --> 00:02:41,639
Audrey, you're a high school girl.

18
00:02:41,807 --> 00:02:43,684
I'm an agent of the FBI.

19
00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:47,559
So do you want me to leave or what?

20
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:54,322
What I want and what I need
are two different things, Audrey.

21
00:02:55,647 --> 00:03:00,437
When a man joins the Bureau he takes
an oath to uphold certain values.

22
00:03:00,607 --> 00:03:03,644
Values that he's sworn to live by.

23
00:03:05,007 --> 00:03:07,521
This is wrong, Audrey.
We both know it.

24
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:15,238
- But don't you like me?
- I like you very much.

25
00:03:15,407 --> 00:03:18,524
You're beautiful, intelligent, desirable.

26
00:03:18,727 --> 00:03:20,957
Everything a man wants in his life.

27
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:25,206
But what you need right now,
more than anything, is a friend.

28
00:03:25,407 --> 00:03:27,443
Someone who will listen.

29
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:44,564
Friends, huh?

30
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:52,077
I'm gonna go and get us two malts
and some fries.

31
00:03:52,327 --> 00:03:56,002
- Then tell me all your troubles.
- That could take all night.

32
00:03:57,567 --> 00:03:59,603
The night is young.

33
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:04,839
Now, I'm gonna get the food,
and you're gonna get dressed.

34
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:10,318
- I can't tell you all my secrets.
- Secrets are dangerous things.

35
00:04:10,927 --> 00:04:13,885
- Do you have any?
- No.

36
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:15,998
Laura had a lot of secrets.

37
00:04:17,487 --> 00:04:20,559
Finding those out is my job.

38
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:48,917
Good morning, Officer Brennan.

39
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:53,442
I sure wish you would stop calling me
Officer Brennan.

40
00:04:53,847 --> 00:04:56,839
Officer Andy, this is peak activity time

41
00:04:56,967 --> 00:04:59,435
at the station switchboard.

42
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:03,765
So it's really not convenient
for me to talk right now.

43
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:08,157
Twin Peaks Sheriff's Station,
may I help you?

44
00:05:08,487 --> 00:05:10,876
One moment, please.

45
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:23,646
Doctor Stanicek? Yes, it's me.

46
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:28,245
Oh.

47
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,646
Uh-huh.

48
00:05:34,607 --> 00:05:36,040
Well...

49
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:39,286
thank you, Doctor.

50
00:05:40,447 --> 00:05:41,846
No, I'm fine.

51
00:05:43,487 --> 00:05:44,840
Bye.

52
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:55,121
Morning, Lucy.
I heard you were out sick.

53
00:05:55,287 --> 00:05:57,960
I'm much better today, thanks.

54
00:05:59,207 --> 00:06:00,401
Good.

55
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:05,322
I found it: "Gracula religiosa.

56
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,445
"Commonly known as the hill mynah.

57
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:12,157
"Native to Southeast Asia,
Indonesia.

58
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:16,485
"Feeds on fruit mainly,
some invertebrates.

59
00:06:16,687 --> 00:06:19,804
"Its ability to mimic the human voice
is amazing."

60
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:24,757
Yeah, well, so far we haven't heard
a peep. Hey, Waldo, what's up?

61
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:29,836
It says here that mimicry
is a kind of play with the mynah.

62
00:06:30,887 --> 00:06:35,597
But this one's in a weakened condition.
Starved, dehydrated.

63
00:06:36,207 --> 00:06:39,324
I'd say he's feeling anything
but playful.

64
00:06:39,727 --> 00:06:41,718
Here you go, little fella.

65
00:06:42,847 --> 00:06:46,396
- You want to feed him, Agent Cooper?
- I don't like birds.

66
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:49,041
When do you think
he'll start talking?

67
00:06:49,207 --> 00:06:54,998
According to the book, his urge to
mimic should return with his health.

68
00:06:55,207 --> 00:07:00,725
- If it does, then we got a witness.
- Well, we better keep feeding him.

69
00:07:01,447 --> 00:07:05,042
- You got any apples?
- Yeah. There's some in the fridge.

70
00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:10,116
- These grapes are on the edge.
- These came in from your office.

71
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:15,723
Forensics confirms Jacques
had three guests to his cabin:

72
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:19,676
Laura Palmer, Ronnette Pulaski
and Leo Johnson.

73
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:26,043
That was the only exposed negative
on the roll of film. Look familiar?

74
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:29,682
- That's our Waldo.
- No, Harry, the girl.

75
00:07:29,887 --> 00:07:31,718
That's Laura.

76
00:07:33,447 --> 00:07:38,567
Well, now we know who and when.
We don't know why.

77
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,802
Voice activated, Harry.

78
00:07:43,127 --> 00:07:47,643
When the bird talks,
maybe we'll get some answers.

79
00:07:49,687 --> 00:07:52,724
This matches the fragment
found in Laura's stomach.

80
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:58,202
- A chip from One-Eyed Jacks.
- Renault deals in the casino.

81
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:03,157
- A little fieldwork is in order.
- Jacks is over the border.

82
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:05,119
Well, I know that, Harry.

83
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:09,240
That's why I was thinking this would
be a job for the Bookhouse Boys.

84
00:08:26,727 --> 00:08:28,479
Better call Hawk on that one.

85
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:33,398
Shelly!

86
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,320
Bobby Briggs.

87
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:49,764
Come on, lover-boy. Leo's waiting.

88
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:57,283
- I called, but your dad answered.
- Bobby's here, baby. Bobby's here.

89
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:05,835
I shot him, Bobby.

90
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,442
I know I did.

91
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:14,443
He just screamed and screamed.
He sounded like an animal.

92
00:09:14,647 --> 00:09:16,478
You what?

93
00:09:16,727 --> 00:09:19,560
Slow down, Shelly. Talk to me.

94
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:23,396
He's out there, I know he is.
He's gonna kill me.

95
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:27,276
- Bobby, he's gonna kill me.
- Shelly!

96
00:09:28,127 --> 00:09:31,915
Start over. Go real slow.

97
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:38,400
Leo came home late last night.

98
00:09:38,607 --> 00:09:41,440
He was all beat up.
He had blood all over him.

99
00:09:41,927 --> 00:09:47,206
I told him I was never ever
gonna let him hurt me again.

100
00:09:47,407 --> 00:09:52,322
But he came at me.
So I pulled the trigger.

101
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,241
I shot him, Bobby.

102
00:09:57,647 --> 00:10:01,242
What am I gonna do?
Where am I gonna hide?

103
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:06,601
Shelly, Leo Johnson is history.
Understand?

104
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:09,924
I'm taking care of you from now on.

105
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:13,398
I'm gonna deal with Leo.
I'm gonna deal with James.

106
00:10:13,607 --> 00:10:16,041
Bobby's gonna deal with everything.

107
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:32,646
Birdseed? No, this bird eats fruit.
The sheriff says it's a witness.

108
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:38,001
No, not just because it saw something,
because it talks. It needs to eat...

109
00:11:01,207 --> 00:11:03,767
What's up, Doc?

110
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:08,076
Just a few words before I go to sleep.

111
00:11:08,887 --> 00:11:12,357
I feel like I'm gonna dream tonight.

112
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:15,445
Big bad ones, you know?

113
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:19,040
The kind you like.

114
00:11:22,927 --> 00:11:26,044
It's easier talking into the recorder.

115
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:30,157
I guess I feel I can say anything.

116
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:33,165
All my secrets.

117
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:38,436
The naked ones.
I know you like those, Doc.

118
00:11:38,607 --> 00:11:41,724
I know you like me, too.

119
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:44,959
That'll be my little secret, OK?

120
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:48,443
Just like your coconut.

121
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:54,159
Why is it so easy to make men like me?

122
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:57,882
And I don't even have to try
very hard.

123
00:11:58,047 --> 00:12:00,277
Or maybe...

124
00:12:01,047 --> 00:12:03,038
...if it was harder...

125
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:08,642
This one's empty.

126
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:13,959
February 23rd.
The night Laura died.

127
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:21,723
- The tape's not in there.
- He must still have it.

128
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:26,757
- She died, he never returned it.
- Do you think Dr Jacoby killed her?

129
00:12:28,087 --> 00:12:30,965
We're gonna find that tape. Tonight.

130
00:12:31,607 --> 00:12:35,202
- Where?
- Jacoby's office.

131
00:12:35,407 --> 00:12:39,639
- What if he's there?
- We'll get him out.

132
00:12:40,647 --> 00:12:42,046
How?

133
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:47,440
Maybe he gets a phone call.
From Laura.

134
00:12:52,927 --> 00:12:55,521
What's up, Doc?

135
00:12:56,007 --> 00:13:01,400
Just a few words before I go to sleep.
I feel like I'm gonna dream tonight.

136
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:11,206
Here, try this.
It smells like a florist.

137
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:15,521
This won't do.
I want something more fruity.

138
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:18,645
- Fruity?
- As in fruit.

139
00:13:18,887 --> 00:13:23,244
Jenny, could I see you in my office
in five minutes?

140
00:13:23,407 --> 00:13:27,161
I'm not making myself clear.
I want to make a statement.

141
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:30,439
Maybe you should try hanging it
around your neck.

142
00:13:30,647 --> 00:13:33,161
It's a perfume,
it's a fashion accessory.

143
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:35,597
Two statements for the price of one.

144
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:38,918
I don't appreciate your attitude.

145
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:43,837
Well, thank you for shopping
at Horne's Department Store.

146
00:13:52,127 --> 00:13:55,437
- I'm going to the girls' room.
- OK.

147
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:09,682
There's a real bad accident outside.
It sounded like a bus or something.

148
00:14:27,607 --> 00:14:30,405
Come right this way, Jenny.

149
00:14:32,927 --> 00:14:37,284
I have something really special
to talk about today.

150
00:14:37,487 --> 00:14:40,445
Come right in.
My, my, you look lovely.

151
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:44,364
- Sit, sit.
- Thank you, Mr Battis.

152
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:50,324
This is for you, Jenny.
A reward for a job well done.

153
00:15:03,927 --> 00:15:05,440
It's a unicorn.

154
00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:10,801
Ancient symbol of purity.
Tamed only by the young at heart.

155
00:15:11,007 --> 00:15:13,726
Wow, a unicorn.

156
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:20,124
- Have a good time at the club?
- I had a great time, Mr Battis.

157
00:15:20,247 --> 00:15:23,523
They were pleased with you
as well, I must say.

158
00:15:23,727 --> 00:15:27,925
They'd like you to continue.
Believe me, not many girls qualify.

159
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,595
- Really?
- Yes.

160
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:36,803
Now the variety of work is completely
up to you. Hostess, cocktail waitress.

161
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:41,843
Or, if you are chosen,
hospitality girl.

162
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:44,280
What's that?

163
00:15:46,327 --> 00:15:52,357
Hospitality girls escort
important guests, VIPs.

164
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:56,276
It's a lucrative opportunity, Jenny.

165
00:15:56,447 --> 00:16:00,520
Attending to wealthy men
in need of a little company.

166
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,600
That sounds cool.
As long as they're wealthy.

167
00:16:04,087 --> 00:16:09,445
Jenny, your attitude will take you
far in this life.

168
00:16:09,687 --> 00:16:13,282
Call this number, ask for Black Rose.

169
00:16:13,527 --> 00:16:17,076
Why don't we go to Eveningwear
and find you something elegant?

170
00:16:17,327 --> 00:16:20,842
Elegant sounds great, Mr Battis.
Elegant.

171
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:23,766
How do you feel about rose?

172
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,923
Ronnette Pulaski.

173
00:16:57,727 --> 00:17:00,525
In prison, you remember faces
from home.

174
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:03,525
Even people you barely knew
seem like friends.

175
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:07,885
- It's something to hang on to.
- Must've been hard on you.

176
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:12,997
I paid my debt, that's what counts.
You were a really big help around here.

177
00:17:13,207 --> 00:17:16,517
I wanna thank you
for getting Norma through.

178
00:17:16,647 --> 00:17:19,036
You're welcome, Hank.
It's no problem.

179
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:23,803
She told me in her letters how much
it meant, how much Pete helped.

180
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:27,357
- Pete?
- Yeah. No, not Pete...

181
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:29,762
- No, you mean Ed.
- Yeah, Big Ed.

182
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:34,795
Yeah, I'm a little better at faces
than names, I guess.

183
00:17:38,607 --> 00:17:41,167
Yeah, Big Ed.

184
00:17:53,087 --> 00:17:55,999
Shelly, can we get another cup
over here?

185
00:17:57,647 --> 00:18:02,596
- Hello, Hank.
- Hi, Harry. Glad to see me?

186
00:18:03,287 --> 00:18:06,597
You looking for a free lunch?

187
00:18:07,247 --> 00:18:11,035
- I recommend the meatloaf.
- Well, save it. I'm looking for you.

188
00:18:11,287 --> 00:18:14,438
- Harry, I'm innocent.
- What you are is on parole.

189
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:18,676
You pay your case officer
a visit once a week, Fridays.

190
00:18:18,927 --> 00:18:21,600
You miss a visit, you go to jail.
Got it?

191
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,201
Thanks for the reminder, Sheriff.

192
00:18:24,407 --> 00:18:26,682
Stop in any time.

193
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,967
You think people
really change, Cooper?

194
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:32,686
I don't.

195
00:18:32,887 --> 00:18:36,641
Oh, afternoon, guys.
Would you like some coffee?

196
00:18:36,847 --> 00:18:39,725
- Afternoon, Shelly. Yes.
- We should be on our way.

197
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:42,400
Harry...

198
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,795
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

199
00:18:46,007 --> 00:18:50,717
Every day, once a day,
give yourself a present.

200
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:55,961
Don't plan it, don't wait for it,
just let it happen.

201
00:18:56,487 --> 00:19:01,038
Could be a new shirt,
a catnap in your office chair...

202
00:19:01,327 --> 00:19:04,763
or two cups of good,
hot, black coffee.

203
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:07,640
- Like this.
- A present.

204
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:10,839
- Like Christmas?
- Yeah.

205
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,126
Man, that hits the spot.

206
00:19:24,207 --> 00:19:26,004
Nothing like a great cup
of black coffee.

207
00:19:30,007 --> 00:19:31,201
Bye, Audrey.

208
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:34,643
- So did Battis get you a dress?
- Yeah, he did.

209
00:19:34,887 --> 00:19:38,880
- Me, too. I'm gonna be hostess.
- Oh, really. Cool.

210
00:19:39,087 --> 00:19:43,160
- Get one of these, too?
- What will I do with a horned horse?

211
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:47,201
- Ditto. I bet he's cartons of them.
- He probably does.

212
00:19:47,407 --> 00:19:49,523
God, I did a really dumb thing.

213
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:53,925
I lost that number he gave me
for Black Rose, do you have it?

214
00:19:54,807 --> 00:19:56,718
- Yeah. I got it.
- Great.

215
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:02,720
Here.

216
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:07,361
Thanks.

217
00:20:07,647 --> 00:20:11,117
- OK, I'll talk to you later.
- OK, see you tomorrow.

218
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,963
I wasn't fooling, Montana.

219
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:31,605
You show them, Chet.
You show all of them.

220
00:20:37,287 --> 00:20:41,997
Tune in tomorrow for
"Invitation to Love".

221
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:47,880
Ed.

222
00:20:49,327 --> 00:20:51,966
I'm eating bonbons.

223
00:20:57,607 --> 00:21:02,681
- Come on, honey. It's not that bad.
- You don't know how bad it is.

224
00:21:03,287 --> 00:21:07,485
You don't know all the things
I was gonna do for us.

225
00:21:07,687 --> 00:21:09,200
I know.

226
00:21:09,847 --> 00:21:13,203
A new TV. I was gonna do that.

227
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:17,355
- I already looked at a motorboat.
- Sweetheart...

228
00:21:18,687 --> 00:21:24,398
It wasn't just things I was gonna buy.
It was the new life we were gonna lead.

229
00:21:24,647 --> 00:21:27,366
Nadine, there's plenty
of patent attorneys.

230
00:21:27,527 --> 00:21:31,122
We just gotta find one
who understands drape runners.

231
00:21:31,247 --> 00:21:36,401
Rejected.
Rejected, that's what he said.

232
00:21:36,647 --> 00:21:42,643
- Nobody will say anything different.
- Don't give up. Don't you dare.

233
00:21:49,127 --> 00:21:54,360
I just got that baby back
from Tim and Tom's Taxidermy.

234
00:21:56,527 --> 00:22:00,076
When I caught him,
he was this big.

235
00:22:00,287 --> 00:22:05,202
I guess by the time they take the
innards out and put the stuffing in...

236
00:22:05,447 --> 00:22:08,359
it loses something
in the translation.

237
00:22:08,607 --> 00:22:13,601
Well, Pete, it's still a fine looking
trophy, no matter what the size.

238
00:22:13,847 --> 00:22:18,637
Yeah, well,
size isn't everything, I guess.

239
00:22:18,887 --> 00:22:23,199
Harry, I didn't expect you
to be here.

240
00:22:24,207 --> 00:22:28,439
I'm late for the mill,
but I'll make time for us.

241
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:30,396
What's wrong?

242
00:22:30,607 --> 00:22:34,361
What were you doing
at the Timber Falls Motel Tuesday?

243
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,963
- Tuesday, I was at the mill.
- Hawk saw you.

244
00:22:39,207 --> 00:22:41,721
I know you were there.

245
00:22:44,287 --> 00:22:45,720
Harry...

246
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:52,157
You can tell me anything.
Josie, you can tell me anything.

247
00:22:52,647 --> 00:22:58,483
I was there because Ben and Catherine
were there together.

248
00:22:58,927 --> 00:23:03,762
I followed them, and I took pictures.

249
00:23:15,407 --> 00:23:17,443
What's this all about?

250
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:21,077
You asked me for proof last time...

251
00:23:21,287 --> 00:23:25,724
and I followed them
and I took pictures.

252
00:23:27,127 --> 00:23:31,120
The other night I heard Catherine
talking on the phone.

253
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:36,242
Something about an accident.
A fire.

254
00:23:36,447 --> 00:23:38,756
A fire at the mill.

255
00:23:40,247 --> 00:23:45,241
A fire at Andrew's mill. My mill.

256
00:23:47,007 --> 00:23:51,478
I'm not gonna let this happen. No.

257
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:58,838
Neither will I. I won't let it happen.

258
00:24:12,807 --> 00:24:17,756
- Well, now.
- Evening, Harry. Ed, you all set?

259
00:24:18,367 --> 00:24:21,200
- Is that what you're wearing?
- It's pretty spiffy.

260
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:23,079
Like to gamble, Ed?

261
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:27,119
I went to Reno once.
But I never felt too lucky.

262
00:24:27,287 --> 00:24:29,437
Well, you're gonna be lucky tonight.

263
00:24:31,287 --> 00:24:34,836
It's $10,000 of the Bureau's money.

264
00:24:35,967 --> 00:24:41,644
Whenever I gamble, I bring back 10 to
15°/. How much you wanna start with?

265
00:24:41,887 --> 00:24:44,720
How about 300?

266
00:24:45,287 --> 00:24:47,676
And, Ed, the suit is perfect.

267
00:24:49,327 --> 00:24:51,795
Well, Harry'd like to talk with you.

268
00:24:52,047 --> 00:24:55,039
So why don't I see you outside?

269
00:24:57,087 --> 00:24:59,317
Yeah, Harry, what's on your mind?

270
00:25:00,527 --> 00:25:03,758
I'm worried about Josie.
She's been real afraid.

271
00:25:03,967 --> 00:25:07,198
- About what?
- Ben Horne and Catherine Martell.

272
00:25:07,687 --> 00:25:12,886
They've seen each other on the side
for years, Josie just found out.

273
00:25:13,087 --> 00:25:19,083
She thinks they're planning to burn
down the mill and get rid of her.

274
00:25:19,447 --> 00:25:21,358
Well, do you believe her?

275
00:25:21,527 --> 00:25:24,917
Ben Horne wants that land
for Ghostwood development,

276
00:25:25,047 --> 00:25:26,605
and Josie won't sell.

277
00:25:26,727 --> 00:25:30,117
- Yeah, I believe her.
- How much do you know about her?

278
00:25:30,287 --> 00:25:32,960
Where she's from?
Who she was before?

279
00:25:33,207 --> 00:25:36,438
- What are you getting at?
- The truth. That's my job.

280
00:25:36,647 --> 00:25:40,560
I know all I need to know.
I love her, and she's in trouble.

281
00:25:40,927 --> 00:25:43,999
That's good enough for me.
Let's look into it.

282
00:25:44,967 --> 00:25:46,764
Thanks.

283
00:25:46,967 --> 00:25:50,357
- Is Hawk ready?
- Yeah, he's outside in the van.

284
00:25:50,607 --> 00:25:55,920
- I got that new Cadillac you wanted.
- Good. It's perfect for our cover.

285
00:25:56,127 --> 00:26:00,200
- High rollers from the Tri-Cities?
- Oral surgeons, Harry.

286
00:26:00,407 --> 00:26:03,843
Big spenders vacationing
among the firs.

287
00:26:18,487 --> 00:26:21,445
Yeah, has Agent Cooper returned yet?

288
00:26:21,687 --> 00:26:25,999
I need to leave another message.
Tell him that Audrey called again.

289
00:26:26,247 --> 00:26:28,681
Yes, it's still urgent.

290
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:35,284
- Thanks for seeing me, Mrs Martell.
- It's all right.

291
00:26:35,447 --> 00:26:39,918
- Normally I never impose this late.
- That's fine. What's this about?

292
00:26:40,087 --> 00:26:43,397
Every agent is instructed,
five signatures...

293
00:26:43,647 --> 00:26:46,445
and, somehow, we missed one.

294
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:51,243
- Refresh my memory. What policy?
- Your new life insurance.

295
00:26:51,367 --> 00:26:57,397
Since the binder takes effect tonight,
I had no choice. It couldn't wait.

296
00:26:58,127 --> 00:27:00,402
Right here, please.

297
00:27:05,047 --> 00:27:07,925
Is everything in order, Mrs Martell?

298
00:27:09,047 --> 00:27:10,526
Yes, it's just...

299
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:20,764
This was handled without our meeting
each other, and I'd almost forgotten.

300
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:25,319
To be honest with you, Mrs Martell,
I withheld that last page.

301
00:27:25,487 --> 00:27:29,446
- Did you?
- I admit, I thought it unusual.

302
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:33,356
Life insurance, and the client
is too busy to be involved?

303
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:36,963
I mean, you did know
about this policy, didn't you?

304
00:27:37,487 --> 00:27:41,878
Are you suggesting that there's
something irregular at work here?

305
00:27:42,007 --> 00:27:46,523
I never got that idea from
Mrs Packard. Or from Mr Horne.

306
00:27:46,727 --> 00:27:51,118
When he offered to collect signatures,
I thought it was fine. Just with...

307
00:27:51,287 --> 00:27:55,724
a new account, I like to be
certain to cross every "t".

308
00:27:55,887 --> 00:27:57,957
Right here, please.

309
00:27:58,167 --> 00:28:03,366
You know, I'm noticing there
are some minor changes

310
00:28:03,567 --> 00:28:08,118
that I asked my attorney to make
that are not included in this draft.

311
00:28:08,327 --> 00:28:11,763
I'd like to go over this
with him in the morning

312
00:28:12,007 --> 00:28:17,479
and initial the changes and get
the documents to you at that time.

313
00:28:17,687 --> 00:28:22,203
If there's anything that I can do
to help you...

314
00:28:22,807 --> 00:28:26,277
with the policy,
or anything at all...

315
00:28:27,447 --> 00:28:32,567
- Are you an ambitious man, Mr Neff?
- One likes to think so.

316
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:38,320
One never knows. There may be
a few "t's" left to cross.

317
00:28:39,407 --> 00:28:43,116
- Goodnight.
- Mrs Martell.

318
00:28:44,887 --> 00:28:47,355
I'll see myself out.

319
00:28:57,647 --> 00:28:59,160
Think.

320
00:29:00,967 --> 00:29:02,366
Think.

321
00:29:38,727 --> 00:29:40,922
Ed, why don't you open that up?

322
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:45,084
Wow. Look at all this.

323
00:29:46,607 --> 00:29:48,563
Well, I'm sorry.

324
00:29:49,207 --> 00:29:53,883
There's a curly-haired wig in there.
Ed, it's gonna work like gangbusters.

325
00:29:54,087 --> 00:29:56,885
I'll help you on
with one of those moustaches.

326
00:29:57,087 --> 00:30:01,797
- Will it fit? I've got a big head.
- OK, give it a try.

327
00:30:02,727 --> 00:30:05,400
Testing: one, two.

328
00:30:18,287 --> 00:30:20,562
Laura.

329
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:22,998
Laura.

330
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:05,922
- What happened?
- Somebody shot Waldo.

331
00:31:06,327 --> 00:31:07,760
Ah, Jesus.

332
00:31:10,087 --> 00:31:11,566
Poor Waldo.

333
00:31:17,287 --> 00:31:20,916
- What happened?
- Somebody shot Waldo.

334
00:31:24,327 --> 00:31:25,760
Birdie, birdie, birdie.

335
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:29,886
Want some orange?
Come on, let's share.

336
00:31:33,007 --> 00:31:34,565
Hello, Waldo.

337
00:31:40,127 --> 00:31:41,845
Laura.

338
00:31:42,047 --> 00:31:43,719
Laura.

339
00:31:44,287 --> 00:31:46,198
Don't go there.

340
00:31:50,887 --> 00:31:54,357
Hurting me. Hurting me.

341
00:31:55,287 --> 00:31:58,484
Stop it! Stop it!

342
00:32:00,887 --> 00:32:02,843
Stop it!

343
00:32:04,287 --> 00:32:08,360
Leo, no! Leo, no!

344
00:32:26,687 --> 00:32:28,518
Casino's probably in the back.

345
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:30,877
If Jacques is dealing,
he'll be there.

346
00:32:31,087 --> 00:32:34,204
Well, I'll give you the high sign
and clear out.

347
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:39,404
- Here comes something.
- Evening, fellas.

348
00:32:39,607 --> 00:32:42,599
- They call me Blackie.
- Glad to know you.

349
00:32:42,807 --> 00:32:46,243
- I like your style.
- Most do. First time here?

350
00:32:46,607 --> 00:32:50,680
- Yeah, it's our rookie season.
- Tonight is spring training.

351
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:54,197
With a little luck,
you just might make the team.

352
00:32:54,767 --> 00:32:56,758
You look like a cop.

353
00:32:56,927 --> 00:32:58,883
I'm the cop.

354
00:33:00,247 --> 00:33:03,637
You look like Cary Grant.
Got a name?

355
00:33:03,847 --> 00:33:07,237
Barney and Fred.
Just in from the Tri-Cities.

356
00:33:07,447 --> 00:33:12,157
- Well, Fred, what's your line?
- Own a gas station.

357
00:33:13,007 --> 00:33:15,237
I'm an oral surgeon.

358
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:19,566
I've got a Chevy parked out back
with a serious root canal problem.

359
00:33:20,087 --> 00:33:21,645
Wanna take a look?

360
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:26,716
I was hoping you needed gum work.
I'd sure like a look under your hood.

361
00:33:26,887 --> 00:33:30,163
- Fred's OK.
- Fred's a prince.

362
00:33:30,327 --> 00:33:33,763
- So, boys, what's your pleasure?
- Cards. Dice.

363
00:33:33,967 --> 00:33:35,559
For starters.

364
00:33:35,687 --> 00:33:39,475
Casino's that way.
This might just be your lucky night.

365
00:33:39,607 --> 00:33:42,075
Luck has nothing to do with it.

366
00:33:43,327 --> 00:33:46,558
Not bad, Ed. Not bad at all.

367
00:33:56,287 --> 00:34:00,439
Hawk, we have a small casino room
with the usual games of chance.

368
00:34:00,607 --> 00:34:04,282
Bar's at the far end,
and there's stairs to who knows where.

369
00:34:04,487 --> 00:34:06,398
Everybody's having a good time.

370
00:34:06,727 --> 00:34:09,116
No sign of Jacques Renault.

371
00:34:09,287 --> 00:34:13,678
Ed's gonna head to the craps table.
I'm gonna play some blackjack.

372
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:17,243
Ed, let's gamble.

373
00:35:53,687 --> 00:35:57,646
You simply have got to teach me
some of these incredible songs.

374
00:35:58,087 --> 00:35:59,759
- Incredible!
- Incredible.

375
00:35:59,927 --> 00:36:04,876
Jerry? Maybe you'd like to take some
of our guests down to the dining room.

376
00:36:07,847 --> 00:36:10,805
I'll be with you in a half a tick!

377
00:36:13,567 --> 00:36:17,196
You should've seen them
at this tour of the site. The trees!

378
00:36:17,367 --> 00:36:19,278
- Jerry.
- They worship them.

379
00:36:19,487 --> 00:36:22,206
I caught a couple of them
hugging pine.

380
00:36:22,407 --> 00:36:24,875
When are they signing
the contracts?

381
00:36:25,087 --> 00:36:27,317
This needs more pecan.
They're ready.

382
00:36:27,487 --> 00:36:30,524
They're poised with their pen
in their hand.

383
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:34,920
- So, what's the catch?
- More fun.

384
00:36:35,087 --> 00:36:39,763
Signing party. They want to finalise
the deal at One-Eyed Jacks.

385
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:43,761
How'd they find out about Jacks?

386
00:36:45,927 --> 00:36:47,758
I take full responsibility.

387
00:36:48,847 --> 00:36:53,477
Jerry, Jerry.
Get them back on the van.

388
00:36:57,127 --> 00:37:00,437
OK, everybody back in the van.

389
00:37:00,967 --> 00:37:06,519
- Road trip! Road trip!
- Going on a road trip! Road trip!

390
00:37:16,687 --> 00:37:18,962
- Hello.
- Is she there?

391
00:37:20,367 --> 00:37:22,244
I just came back. She's gone.

392
00:37:22,967 --> 00:37:26,323
- We need her at the mill.
- I'll get her there.

393
00:37:26,487 --> 00:37:29,604
- Is it set for tonight?
- Yes.

394
00:37:29,807 --> 00:37:34,756
- You shouldn't call for a while.
- I know the drill.

395
00:38:01,567 --> 00:38:05,958
- You're not a shy one, are you?
- I'm not shy.

396
00:38:19,407 --> 00:38:21,284
Hester Prynne.

397
00:38:21,487 --> 00:38:25,765
Pretty name.
Maple House in Vancouver...

398
00:38:25,927 --> 00:38:28,282
Roy's in Chicago...

399
00:38:28,487 --> 00:38:31,957
Calgary Stampede '87 through '89.

400
00:38:32,607 --> 00:38:35,758
- Where'd you work in Calgary?
- Around.

401
00:38:35,887 --> 00:38:37,445
Can you give me a name?

402
00:38:38,487 --> 00:38:40,364
The Lost Dude Ranch.

403
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,601
Big Amos still running things
out there?

404
00:38:45,807 --> 00:38:47,763
Bigger and better.

405
00:38:51,327 --> 00:38:54,125
Big Amos is the name of my dog.

406
00:38:54,287 --> 00:38:57,199
I read "The Scarlet Letter"
in high school, too.

407
00:38:57,367 --> 00:39:02,316
Give me one reason why I shouldn't
airmail you back to civilisation.

408
00:39:50,127 --> 00:39:51,958
Sign here.

409
00:39:52,407 --> 00:39:55,319
Welcome to One-Eyed Jacks, Hester.

410
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:03,361
21 again. Another winner.

411
00:40:04,687 --> 00:40:06,086
How did you do?

412
00:40:06,287 --> 00:40:10,166
- Do I have to pay you back?
- We'll take it out of my winnings.

413
00:40:10,327 --> 00:40:12,921
- Care to sit in?
- Blackjack is not my game.

414
00:40:13,087 --> 00:40:15,396
- Can you count to 10?
- On a good night.

415
00:40:15,607 --> 00:40:17,802
Then you can win at blackjack.

416
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:24,362
Gentlemen, place your bets.

417
00:40:26,607 --> 00:40:29,519
- Jacques, is it?
- That's me.

418
00:40:32,567 --> 00:40:35,240
Jade, here's to old times.

419
00:40:35,887 --> 00:40:38,242
"Should old acquaintance be forgot?"

420
00:40:44,687 --> 00:40:49,556
Come on, baby. Bottoms up.
One for the road. For old times' sake.

421
00:40:49,727 --> 00:40:51,479
Aloha.

422
00:40:54,247 --> 00:40:57,557
Hey, what's up, Doc?

423
00:40:57,727 --> 00:41:00,844
Feel like I'm gonna dream tonight.

424
00:41:01,007 --> 00:41:03,760
Big bad ones. You know?

425
00:41:03,887 --> 00:41:05,161
The kind you like.

426
00:41:05,807 --> 00:41:10,085
- Who is this?
- Who do you think it is, silly?

427
00:41:10,967 --> 00:41:12,366
I want to see you.

428
00:41:13,007 --> 00:41:15,885
- You're not Laura.
- OK, Doc.

429
00:41:17,247 --> 00:41:21,035
First thing you have to do is
go to the door.

430
00:41:22,767 --> 00:41:24,280
Go on.

431
00:41:24,887 --> 00:41:27,765
There's something waiting for you.

432
00:42:15,727 --> 00:42:17,922
That's today's paper, Doc.

433
00:42:18,087 --> 00:42:19,725
Now do you believe me?

434
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:26,282
Meet me at Sparkwood and 21
in 10 minutes.

435
00:42:28,487 --> 00:42:29,886
But wait...

436
00:42:35,847 --> 00:42:37,838
You think he bought it?

437
00:42:39,087 --> 00:42:40,839
I think so.

438
00:42:41,487 --> 00:42:43,478
I think he did.

439
00:42:44,447 --> 00:42:47,200
OK, wait here for us.

440
00:43:44,087 --> 00:43:45,361
Gazebo.

441
00:44:42,527 --> 00:44:45,360
Say goodbye, James.
