1
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,598
Gone fishing.

2
00:03:33,327 --> 00:03:37,320
The lonesome foghorn blows.

3
00:04:28,127 --> 00:04:29,845
Oh, dear.

4
00:04:32,087 --> 00:04:35,682
Lucy, this is Pete Martell.

5
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:38,241
Lucy, put Harry on the horn.

6
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:41,439
Sheriff, it's Pete Martell
up at the mill.

7
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:45,162
I'm going to transfer it to the phone
on the table by the red chair.

8
00:04:45,287 --> 00:04:47,403
The red chair against the wall.

9
00:04:47,527 --> 00:04:52,681
The little table with the lamp on it,
the lamp we moved from the corner.

10
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:56,398
The black phone,
not the brown phone.

11
00:05:00,807 --> 00:05:04,322
- Morning, Pete. Harry.
- She's dead.

12
00:05:05,287 --> 00:05:07,118
Wrapped in plastic.

13
00:05:07,247 --> 00:05:09,636
Hold on a second, Pete.

14
00:05:11,047 --> 00:05:13,038
Where?

15
00:05:13,687 --> 00:05:16,326
You stay right there.
I'm on my way.

16
00:05:22,247 --> 00:05:26,843
Better get Dr Hayward.
Tell him to meet up at the Packard mill.

17
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:30,084
Roust Andy out of bed.
Tell him to get up there now.

18
00:05:30,207 --> 00:05:32,926
- What is it?
- We've got a body up there.

19
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:37,439
Lucy, not a word about this to anyone
till you hear from me.

20
00:05:58,607 --> 00:06:00,563
It's over here.

21
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:14,116
- You want forensics first?
- No, she's been in the water.

22
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,601
We'd better take some pictures.

23
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:23,602
- Who is she?
- Andy, the pictures.

24
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:26,321
- Sorry.
- Then we'll turn her over.

25
00:06:48,527 --> 00:06:51,325
Same thing as last year
in Mr Blodgett's barn.

26
00:06:51,447 --> 00:06:54,245
- Give me the camera.
- Sorry.

27
00:06:54,367 --> 00:06:56,642
Is this going to happen
every damn time?

28
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,884
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

29
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:04,398
Why don't you go up to the coroner's van
and bring back that stretcher?

30
00:07:04,527 --> 00:07:06,916
OK. Sorry.

31
00:07:10,567 --> 00:07:13,206
Harry, let's roll her over.

32
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:36,077
Good Lord, Laura!

33
00:07:38,447 --> 00:07:40,403
Laura Palmer.

34
00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:50,597
Laura, sweetheart,
I'm not going to tell you again.

35
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,325
Yes, I am.

36
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:12,559
For goodness' sake.

37
00:08:17,927 --> 00:08:20,236
Laura, now means now.

38
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,924
Laura, honey, are you downstairs?

39
00:09:06,527 --> 00:09:08,643
- Hello.
- Beth, it's Sarah.

40
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:12,680
I just went up to wake Laura
and she's not here. Is she with Bobby?

41
00:09:12,807 --> 00:09:17,005
She could be. He goes running at 5:00 am
and then he goes to football practice.

42
00:09:17,127 --> 00:09:21,678
Can you find out? Can you reach him?
I'll call the school.

43
00:09:21,807 --> 00:09:24,401
I've got the number
of the field office here.

44
00:09:24,527 --> 00:09:26,483
Thanks, Beth.

45
00:09:28,087 --> 00:09:31,875
I wonder if she went out with Leland?
He had an early meeting.

46
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:36,079
I'm sure that's it.
Either that or she's with Bobby.

47
00:09:36,207 --> 00:09:40,086
Sure. I'll call up to the hotel.
Thanks.

48
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:50,676
No, Bobby hasn't shown up
for practice yet today.

49
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:55,637
As a matter of fact, he's been late
every day this week, Mrs Palmer.

50
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:58,884
And last week.
Maybe even the week before.

51
00:10:36,447 --> 00:10:39,598
- Are they ready to sign?
- You're not going to mention

52
00:10:39,727 --> 00:10:43,436
that we haven't yet
acquired access to the Packard land?

53
00:10:46,047 --> 00:10:47,639
Sorry.

54
00:10:50,087 --> 00:10:53,045
We have solid information

55
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:57,875
that the Packard sawmill is going
to go belly up within a year.

56
00:10:58,007 --> 00:11:02,239
We'll be able to get it for a song.
One verse, no chorus.

57
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:05,999
Now...

58
00:11:06,127 --> 00:11:11,440
let's get out there and get
those cheese eaters where they live.

59
00:11:12,207 --> 00:11:14,004
Benjamin.

60
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:21,125
...a clean, wholesome environment,
much like your own.

61
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:26,765
With a quality of life
to rival the very best

62
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,606
that this country has to offer.

63
00:11:29,727 --> 00:11:34,926
That is what the Ghostwood
Country Club and Estates will be.

64
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,722
When I first spoke to Sven,

65
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:46,001
he was naturally very concerned
about the quality of air here.

66
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:52,922
If you'll permit me, Sven, to repeat
what you said this morning after your run:

67
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:57,319
"My air sacks have never felt so good!"

68
00:12:02,927 --> 00:12:06,442
Your wife's on the phone again.
She said it's urgent.

69
00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:12,805
Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.
I'll be right back.

70
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,478
Make it snappy.

71
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:19,125
So...

72
00:12:19,927 --> 00:12:21,724
...here in Twin Peaks,

73
00:12:21,847 --> 00:12:25,760
health and industry
go hand in hand.

74
00:12:28,087 --> 00:12:30,965
- I'll transfer you to the house phone.
- Thank you.

75
00:12:38,247 --> 00:12:40,966
- Sarah, what is it?
- Is Laura with you?

76
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,521
- No, why?
- She didn't go with you this morning?

77
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,559
No. Honey, what's wrong?
What's this all about?

78
00:12:46,687 --> 00:12:51,602
- She wasn't here this morning.
- She's probably with Bobby.

79
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:55,602
- I can't find Bobby.
- There you are. That's it.

80
00:12:55,727 --> 00:12:58,958
Let's not worry.
They're probably together.

81
00:12:59,087 --> 00:13:01,920
She would have left me a note.
She would have told me.

82
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:04,607
Honey, take it easy, please.

83
00:13:04,727 --> 00:13:09,596
- I'm looking for Leland Palmer.
- He's right over there on the phone.

84
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:12,603
Sheriff Truman.

85
00:13:12,807 --> 00:13:15,560
What? Who? What did you say?

86
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:21,965
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

87
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,485
Leland, please. What is it?
Tell me.

88
00:13:32,527 --> 00:13:35,758
- Leland...
- Is this about Laura?

89
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:38,717
I'm afraid it is.

90
00:13:41,527 --> 00:13:43,722
Leland, tell me.

91
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:46,403
My baby!

92
00:13:56,527 --> 00:13:58,483
We're ready
to go with the contracts.

93
00:14:03,807 --> 00:14:06,275
Leland, what's wrong?

94
00:14:09,207 --> 00:14:11,801
My daughter's dead.

95
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,843
What kept you, Heidi?

96
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:15,245
- I couldn't get my car started.
- Too busy jump-starting the old man?

97
00:15:17,327 --> 00:15:20,478
I thought you Germans
were always on time.

98
00:15:25,527 --> 00:15:28,678
I thought the only time you cared about,
Bobby, was making time.

99
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:33,120
- You heading out, Shelly?
- Yeah, I'm heading home.

100
00:15:33,727 --> 00:15:36,321
I'm going to practice.
I can drop you on the way.

101
00:15:38,927 --> 00:15:41,236
That would be great, thanks.

102
00:15:47,607 --> 00:15:49,962
Here's a tune for you, gals.

103
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:55,079
Norma...

104
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,238
...l'll see you in my dreams.

105
00:15:59,327 --> 00:16:01,283
Not if I see you first.

106
00:16:02,607 --> 00:16:05,201
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

107
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:21,596
- I think she knows about us.
- Norma?

108
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:27,240
Fat chance. I think she's hot to try
for you herself.

109
00:16:55,207 --> 00:16:57,516
It's happy hour in France.

110
00:16:58,287 --> 00:17:00,755
Come on, cowboy.
Light your fire.

111
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:04,402
Right, just a little pick-me-up
before homeroom.

112
00:17:09,247 --> 00:17:12,045
I thought I was your little pick-me-up.

113
00:17:12,487 --> 00:17:16,480
Baby, you are more like
a three-stage rocket.

114
00:17:17,687 --> 00:17:19,882
A pocket rocket.

115
00:17:20,847 --> 00:17:23,884
And what stage are we in now?

116
00:17:25,047 --> 00:17:28,278
Are you sure that your old man
is still on the road?

117
00:17:28,927 --> 00:17:31,395
Yes, he called me last night
from Butte.

118
00:17:31,527 --> 00:17:35,236
That's a long way away
and he ain't got a phone in his truck.

119
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:39,042
Quit worrying and start screwing,
Mr Touchdown.

120
00:17:43,247 --> 00:17:44,760
Butte!

121
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:46,639
Back up!

122
00:17:52,607 --> 00:17:54,165
I'll call you later.

123
00:18:10,927 --> 00:18:13,077
Leland, I'm so sorry.

124
00:18:13,647 --> 00:18:15,763
17 years old.

125
00:18:21,527 --> 00:18:25,805
- Lee, I hate to put you through this.
- No, I have to see her.

126
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:30,157
I have to see what was done
to my little girl.

127
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,764
My baby!

128
00:19:00,647 --> 00:19:02,399
That's my little girl.

129
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:06,125
- God!
- Let's get out of here.

130
00:19:55,607 --> 00:19:58,326
- Have you seen Laura?
- No, not yet.

131
00:19:58,727 --> 00:20:01,321
Nice day for a picnic.

132
00:20:17,487 --> 00:20:20,081
Bobby Briggs, they're looking for you.

133
00:20:20,207 --> 00:20:21,959
- Who is?
- Sheriff is.

134
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,521
Well, here I am in school.

135
00:20:29,207 --> 00:20:30,959
Hey, Snake.

136
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:35,246
- Something's up.
- Where?

137
00:20:35,727 --> 00:20:38,844
- You think I'm kidding?
- What, me worried?

138
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:41,640
Bobby, you're wanted in the office.

139
00:20:41,767 --> 00:20:45,316
- Who wants me in the office?
- Right now, young man.

140
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:48,799
Watch out.

141
00:21:03,647 --> 00:21:05,399
- Terry Franklin?
- Here.

142
00:21:05,527 --> 00:21:07,040
- Martha Grimes?
- Here.

143
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:09,283
- Donna Hayward?
- Here.

144
00:21:09,407 --> 00:21:11,841
- Audrey Horne?
- Here.

145
00:21:11,967 --> 00:21:13,764
James Hurley?

146
00:21:15,727 --> 00:21:17,843
Excuse me. Room 106?

147
00:21:19,527 --> 00:21:22,644
Is there a Bobby Briggs
in this classroom?

148
00:21:22,767 --> 00:21:25,565
No, he's in 107.
107.

149
00:21:25,687 --> 00:21:29,077
- Could I speak to you for a moment?
- Certainly.

150
00:21:36,967 --> 00:21:39,117
...making the announcement.

151
00:21:42,207 --> 00:21:44,118
Thank you for your time.

152
00:22:09,447 --> 00:22:12,996
There'll be an announcement
from the Principal.

153
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:28,805
I told you.

154
00:22:28,927 --> 00:22:33,364
I got up early like I always do.
I went running like I always do.

155
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:35,603
I had breakfast at the RR

156
00:22:35,727 --> 00:22:38,605
and I didn't go to practice
because I didn't feel like it.

157
00:22:38,727 --> 00:22:42,117
Why not, Bobby?
Were you upset about something?

158
00:22:42,247 --> 00:22:45,000
You want to tell us about it?

159
00:22:45,127 --> 00:22:48,915
Look, you guys, what did I do?
What's going on?

160
00:22:49,047 --> 00:22:51,720
Mr Wolchezk, there's rumours
all over school.

161
00:22:51,847 --> 00:22:54,645
Maybe it's best
if they heard it from you.

162
00:22:54,767 --> 00:22:58,043
Mr Wolchezk, why don't you go ahead
and make that announcement?

163
00:22:58,167 --> 00:23:00,681
- Now?
- Now's the time.

164
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:03,359
Excuse me.

165
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:07,044
What is it, Sheriff?
What's going on?

166
00:23:09,647 --> 00:23:11,922
Bobby, you look at me.

167
00:23:12,927 --> 00:23:16,602
Your girlfriend Laura Palmer's
been killed.

168
00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:19,639
She was found just after dawn.

169
00:23:20,807 --> 00:23:26,439
She was with you last night. You weren't
where you should have been this morning.

170
00:23:26,567 --> 00:23:30,162
Have these fellows
advised you of your rights?

171
00:23:30,287 --> 00:23:33,359
Yes, but I didn't know why.

172
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:37,002
- Laura's dead?
- Yes.

173
00:23:37,127 --> 00:23:41,484
Did you understand your rights
as they were explained to you?

174
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,322
You think I killed her?

175
00:23:45,447 --> 00:23:48,041
Bobby, you can phone your parents

176
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:52,319
and they can arrange for a lawyer
to be with you when we talk again.

177
00:23:53,047 --> 00:23:56,403
Andy, take Bobby out to make his call.

178
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:04,357
I loved her.

179
00:24:05,727 --> 00:24:08,719
And she loved me.

180
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:13,318
Because I wasn't at football practice
I killed my girlfriend? You are crazy!

181
00:24:13,447 --> 00:24:15,358
You get off me.

182
00:24:15,927 --> 00:24:19,715
Bobby, we're going to talk
about this later.

183
00:24:21,687 --> 00:24:25,566
May I have your attention, please.
This is Principal Wolchezk.

184
00:24:26,807 --> 00:24:30,322
I am deeply saddened
to have to tell you

185
00:24:31,487 --> 00:24:36,003
that early this morning your classmate
Laura Palmer was found dead.

186
00:24:38,287 --> 00:24:41,563
This is a terrible moment
for all of us.

187
00:24:43,367 --> 00:24:48,805
For all of us who knew her.
Her friends, her family.

188
00:24:51,487 --> 00:24:53,000
It is very important

189
00:24:53,127 --> 00:24:57,598
that we all try to help each other
through this difficult time.

190
00:25:00,447 --> 00:25:04,963
The police have asked me
to ask each of you

191
00:25:06,847 --> 00:25:10,442
if you have any information
about Laura's activities

192
00:25:11,247 --> 00:25:13,886
after school yesterday

193
00:25:14,207 --> 00:25:16,801
or yesterday evening,

194
00:25:16,927 --> 00:25:18,963
please come forward.

195
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:25,205
I am dismissing all classes
for the day,

196
00:25:25,327 --> 00:25:29,878
but before we leave
I would like to ask each of you

197
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:37,003
to join me in a moment of silence
for Laura

198
00:25:38,847 --> 00:25:41,236
and her dear memory.

199
00:26:53,807 --> 00:26:56,605
You can talk to her now, Harry.

200
00:26:57,647 --> 00:27:02,721
Do you know what time it was
when you last saw Laura, Mrs Palmer?

201
00:27:05,647 --> 00:27:07,399
- What time?
- Yes.

202
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:11,200
It would have been about nine.

203
00:27:12,647 --> 00:27:16,196
Yes, nine o'clock...

204
00:27:19,407 --> 00:27:21,443
...pm.

205
00:27:21,727 --> 00:27:23,797
She came home from Bobby's

206
00:27:26,007 --> 00:27:28,919
and she was going up the stairs.

207
00:27:30,807 --> 00:27:34,277
Those stairs...right there.

208
00:27:39,927 --> 00:27:44,318
- Who's upstairs?
- Your husband and one of my men.

209
00:27:50,207 --> 00:27:54,120
I can tell from the sounds
that it isn't her.

210
00:28:10,207 --> 00:28:12,084
Her diary.

211
00:28:15,647 --> 00:28:18,684
Do you know where the key
to this is, sir?

212
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:25,245
- Do you have to take that?
- We'll return it as soon as possible.

213
00:28:41,247 --> 00:28:43,715
Did she say anything to you?

214
00:28:47,007 --> 00:28:48,804
No.

215
00:28:50,407 --> 00:28:52,398
She said goodnight.

216
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:58,721
And I said, "Goodnight.

217
00:29:01,847 --> 00:29:05,886
"Goodnight, sweetheart."

218
00:29:18,127 --> 00:29:21,403
Mrs Palmer, can you remember...

219
00:29:21,647 --> 00:29:25,117
Did she make or receive
any phone calls?

220
00:29:27,887 --> 00:29:32,836
I heard her phone ring once.

221
00:29:33,687 --> 00:29:38,044
- About what time was that?
- I don't know who it was.

222
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:45,685
Harry.

223
00:29:49,607 --> 00:29:53,998
That was Lucy. Got a call from a guy
who works at the mill, Janek Pulaski.

224
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:57,278
Says his daughter didn't come home
last night

225
00:29:57,407 --> 00:30:00,922
and she didn't show up at school
today, either.

226
00:30:15,207 --> 00:30:19,086
Two by fours,
four by eights.

227
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:24,080
Two by fours,
four by eights.

228
00:30:28,287 --> 00:30:31,085
Did you hear me?
You can't do that to my workers.

229
00:30:31,207 --> 00:30:34,279
Don't walk away from me.
Come back here.

230
00:30:34,407 --> 00:30:38,116
You're not going anywhere.
You're not going to tell anybody anything.

231
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:40,798
Catherine,

232
00:30:41,287 --> 00:30:44,438
I'm sorry if this offends you,
but I'm the owner of this sawmill.

233
00:30:44,567 --> 00:30:49,004
You don't knowthe first thing
about this mill. That's why I'm running it.

234
00:30:49,127 --> 00:30:52,881
I've never taken this authority before,
but maybe I should have.

235
00:30:53,367 --> 00:30:58,646
- You're not shutting us down.
- Catherine, I have the final say-so.

236
00:30:59,767 --> 00:31:03,760
- Peter, push the plug.
- Pete, don't you dare.

237
00:31:08,047 --> 00:31:10,356
Catherine, please.

238
00:31:13,407 --> 00:31:18,037
Shorty, tell the boys to pull the plug.

239
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,163
That's right.

240
00:31:31,687 --> 00:31:34,804
May I have your attention.
This is Josie Packard.

241
00:31:35,487 --> 00:31:40,845
I have decided that in light of what
has happened, all work here will stop.

242
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:42,161
Bitch!

243
00:31:42,287 --> 00:31:47,122
This morning, as you know,
the body of Miss Laura Palmer...

244
00:31:47,247 --> 00:31:49,886
- What's your name?
- Fred Truax e.

245
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,198
You're fired.

246
00:31:52,887 --> 00:31:57,915
Just now your co-worker and a friend,
Mr Janek Pulaski,

247
00:31:58,047 --> 00:32:01,596
has learned that his daughter,

248
00:32:01,727 --> 00:32:05,800
one of Laura's schoolmates,
is missing since last night.

249
00:32:06,887 --> 00:32:12,007
Today all work here will stop.
The mill will shut down.

250
00:32:14,847 --> 00:32:18,635
Perhaps you can spend the day
with your families.

251
00:32:19,007 --> 00:32:21,601
Thank you all for your attention.

252
00:32:51,327 --> 00:32:53,318
What the hell?

253
00:33:28,447 --> 00:33:30,244
Laura's dead.

254
00:33:32,567 --> 00:33:34,558
Yeah, I heard.

255
00:33:37,847 --> 00:33:39,883
She was the one.

256
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:44,323
Buy you a coffee?

257
00:33:46,047 --> 00:33:48,038
Can't do it.

258
00:33:51,647 --> 00:33:55,356
If you see Donna,
could you give this to her?

259
00:34:04,327 --> 00:34:05,316
Ed!

260
00:34:06,967 --> 00:34:09,640
They said those drapes
would be ready by 10:00.

261
00:34:09,767 --> 00:34:13,203
I want those drapes up by nightfall.

262
00:34:35,487 --> 00:34:41,039
Diane, 11:30 am, February 24th.
I'm entering the town of Twin Peaks.

263
00:34:41,167 --> 00:34:45,126
Five miles south of the Canadian border,
12 miles west of the state line.

264
00:34:45,607 --> 00:34:48,997
I've never seen so many trees
in my life.

265
00:34:49,127 --> 00:34:52,915
As WC Fields would say,
"I'd rather be here than Philadelphia."

266
00:34:53,047 --> 00:34:57,643
54 degrees on a slightly overcast day.
Weatherman said rain.

267
00:34:57,767 --> 00:35:03,160
If you get paid for being wrong
60°/of the time, it'd beat working!

268
00:35:03,287 --> 00:35:07,485
Mileage is 79,345.
Gauge is on reserve.

269
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:12,317
Got to tank up when I get into town.
Remind me to tell you how much that is.

270
00:35:12,487 --> 00:35:17,356
Lunch was $6 and 31 cents
at the Lamplighter Inn.

271
00:35:17,487 --> 00:35:20,240
That's on Highway 2, near Lewis Fork.

272
00:35:20,367 --> 00:35:24,679
That was a tuna fish sandwich,
slice of cherry pie and a cup of coffee.

273
00:35:24,807 --> 00:35:29,358
Damn good food! If you ever get up here,
that cherry pie is worth a stop.

274
00:35:31,847 --> 00:35:34,919
Looks like I'll be meeting up with a...

275
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:39,155
Sheriff Harry S Truman.
Shouldn't be too hard to remember.

276
00:35:39,287 --> 00:35:41,596
He'll be at the Calhoun Memorial Hospital.

277
00:35:41,727 --> 00:35:46,357
Guess we'll take a look at that girl
who crawled down off the mountain.

278
00:35:46,487 --> 00:35:51,003
I'm sure the sheriff can recommend
a clean, reasonably priced motel.

279
00:35:51,127 --> 00:35:54,005
That's what I need:
a clean place, reasonably priced.

280
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:57,677
Diane, I almost forgot.

281
00:35:57,807 --> 00:36:01,880
I've got to find out what trees these are.
They're really something.

282
00:36:03,087 --> 00:36:04,964
- Agent Cooper?
- Yes.

283
00:36:05,087 --> 00:36:07,681
- Sheriff Harry S Truman.
- Dale Cooper, FBI.

284
00:36:07,807 --> 00:36:09,604
- Pleasure.
- Good to meet you.

285
00:36:10,527 --> 00:36:13,883
- Have any trouble finding the place?
- No, no. Fine.

286
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:17,317
Came out over Highway 2
near Lewis Fork.

287
00:36:17,447 --> 00:36:19,403
Stopped at the Lamplighter Inn.

288
00:36:19,527 --> 00:36:22,599
Had a slice of cherry pie.
Incredible.

289
00:36:22,927 --> 00:36:26,158
I'll tell you, we're sure glad
to have the FBI here.

290
00:36:26,287 --> 00:36:30,121
Kind of lucky in a way that Ronnette
stepped out across the state line.

291
00:36:30,247 --> 00:36:33,842
- Whole town's badly shaken up.
- Sure, it's a nice quiet place.

292
00:36:33,967 --> 00:36:36,561
Sheriff, let me stop you
for just a second.

293
00:36:36,687 --> 00:36:39,121
There's a fewthings
we've got to get straight.

294
00:36:39,247 --> 00:36:41,920
It's best to talk about this up front.

295
00:36:42,047 --> 00:36:45,244
When the Bureau gets called in,
the Bureau's in charge.

296
00:36:45,367 --> 00:36:47,403
You'll be working for me.

297
00:36:47,527 --> 00:36:51,600
Sometimes local law enforcement
has a problem with that.

298
00:36:51,727 --> 00:36:53,797
We're glad to have you here.

299
00:36:53,927 --> 00:36:59,001
Sheriff, what kind of fantastic trees
have you got growing round here?

300
00:36:59,367 --> 00:37:02,245
- Big, majestic...
- Douglas firs.

301
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,878
Douglas firs?

302
00:37:07,247 --> 00:37:10,956
Can someone get me a copy
of the coroner's report on the dead girl?

303
00:37:11,087 --> 00:37:13,157
The autopsy hasn't been done yet,

304
00:37:13,287 --> 00:37:17,075
but I'll take you down to the morgue
when we're finished here.

305
00:37:17,207 --> 00:37:18,242
Fine.

306
00:37:22,727 --> 00:37:25,958
Dr Shelvy, this is FBI Agent Cooper.

307
00:37:26,687 --> 00:37:28,643
- Glad to know you.
- Doctor. How's the girl?

308
00:37:28,767 --> 00:37:31,201
She's in shock,
suffering from exposure.

309
00:37:31,327 --> 00:37:34,399
- Can I see her?
- All right, this way.

310
00:37:50,127 --> 00:37:52,800
- Was she raped?
- Several times.

311
00:37:52,927 --> 00:37:56,124
- One perpetrator?
- We're waiting for the results.

312
00:37:56,847 --> 00:37:59,520
Is there any connection
to the dead girl?

313
00:37:59,647 --> 00:38:03,799
Same high school. As far as we know,
they hardly knew each other.

314
00:38:04,167 --> 00:38:06,203
No connection.

315
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:10,847
I'd like to question her.

316
00:38:10,967 --> 00:38:13,959
This girl doesn't even know
where she is or if she is.

317
00:38:14,087 --> 00:38:15,839
What exactly are you saying?

318
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:20,158
We need a CAT scan
and we're not equipped for that here.

319
00:38:20,287 --> 00:38:23,359
My opinion?
She may have neurological damage.

320
00:38:23,487 --> 00:38:25,842
She's not responsive at all.

321
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:31,326
I'd like to examine her fingers.

322
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,603
All right.

323
00:38:43,807 --> 00:38:48,085
- They've already scraped for particles.
- That's not what I'm looking for.

324
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:53,364
There's nothing here, not a thing.

325
00:38:56,127 --> 00:38:58,163
Don't go there.

326
00:38:58,727 --> 00:39:01,161
Don't go there.

327
00:39:01,327 --> 00:39:02,555
Ronnie?

328
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:05,004
Ronnette?

329
00:39:20,847 --> 00:39:23,759
Pull the fish out of the water,
big mouth.

330
00:39:23,887 --> 00:39:26,959
He's got a big mouth
that starts talking to me.

331
00:39:34,767 --> 00:39:36,325
Harry!

332
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:38,395
Dr Jacoby.

333
00:39:40,407 --> 00:39:43,524
- Terrible, terrible tragedy.
- Yes.

334
00:39:48,527 --> 00:39:51,200
This is Special Agent Dale Cooper.

335
00:39:51,327 --> 00:39:53,761
- Gary Cooper?
- Agent Cooper.

336
00:39:53,887 --> 00:39:57,402
- Agent? FBI.
- Right.

337
00:39:58,087 --> 00:40:03,366
Dr Lawrence Jacoby, Agent Cooper.
Laura was a patient of mine.

338
00:40:04,247 --> 00:40:06,966
You're going to the morgue.
Do you mind if I join you?

339
00:40:07,087 --> 00:40:09,840
Yes, I do.
Why would you want to?

340
00:40:09,967 --> 00:40:12,401
Sort of against procedure, Doctor.

341
00:40:12,527 --> 00:40:16,042
No offence.
I thought I could be of some help.

342
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:20,604
- You still could be...at another time.
- I understand completely.

343
00:40:21,287 --> 00:40:23,323
By the way...

344
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:26,365
Laura's...Laura's parents.

345
00:40:28,327 --> 00:40:31,364
They didn't know
that she was seeing me.

346
00:40:41,167 --> 00:40:43,397
That guy's a psychiatrist?

347
00:40:48,447 --> 00:40:51,757
I have to apologise again
for the fluorescent lights.

348
00:40:51,887 --> 00:40:55,800
- I think it's a bad transformer.
- That's quite all right.

349
00:40:57,687 --> 00:41:01,646
Agent Cooper, we scraped those nails
when we brought her in.

350
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:07,563
There it is. There it is.
My God, here it is!

351
00:41:07,687 --> 00:41:09,962
- What?
- Would you leave us, please?

352
00:41:10,087 --> 00:41:12,840
- Jim.
- Would you leave us alone, please?

353
00:41:12,967 --> 00:41:14,923
Certainly.

354
00:41:17,367 --> 00:41:20,040
I need something
to grab onto this with.

355
00:41:42,927 --> 00:41:46,602
Diane, I'm at the Twin Peaks County
Morgue with the body of the victim.

356
00:41:46,727 --> 00:41:48,445
Laura Palmer.

357
00:41:48,567 --> 00:41:50,876
Diane, it's the same thing.

358
00:41:51,007 --> 00:41:54,477
- I told you we'd see this again.
- What have you got there?

359
00:41:55,127 --> 00:41:58,039
Ring finger, under the nail.

360
00:41:59,407 --> 00:42:01,796
Let's see what he left us.

361
00:42:04,967 --> 00:42:06,798
It's an 'R'.

362
00:42:07,967 --> 00:42:11,596
Diane, give this to Albert and his team.
Don't go to Sam.

363
00:42:11,727 --> 00:42:14,116
Albert has a bit more on the ball.

364
00:42:15,007 --> 00:42:19,444
OK, Cooper, are you going to let me in
on what's going on here?

365
00:42:20,807 --> 00:42:23,640
Sheriff, we've got a lot to talk about.

366
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:52,720
- Hi, Ed.
- Hey, Donna.

367
00:43:01,487 --> 00:43:03,637
I'm so sorry.

368
00:43:06,887 --> 00:43:09,321
- Have you seen James yet?
- He came by.

369
00:43:09,447 --> 00:43:11,597
- Is he OK?
- No.

370
00:43:11,727 --> 00:43:15,242
Do you know where he went?
I've already been to the Roadhouse.

371
00:43:15,367 --> 00:43:18,165
I don't know, honey.
He told me to give you this.

372
00:43:28,287 --> 00:43:31,962
What the hell are you doing?
I've been looking all over for you.

373
00:43:32,087 --> 00:43:35,682
Bobby's in a lot of trouble.
He's my best friend.

374
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:37,923
We're going to the police station
to be with him.

375
00:43:38,047 --> 00:43:43,246
Don't tell me where I ought to be!
Second, Laura was my best friend.

376
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:45,642
- Get in the car.
- Muffle it, junior.

377
00:43:45,767 --> 00:43:48,645
- Mind your own business.
- You're on my lot, friend.

378
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:52,045
Ed, I'm not your friend.

379
00:43:53,167 --> 00:43:55,806
Donna, you get to the Sheriff's
right now.

380
00:44:03,127 --> 00:44:05,687
I sure know howto pick them.

381
00:44:06,207 --> 00:44:10,120
You waiting for those drapes
to hang themselves?

382
00:44:13,047 --> 00:44:15,436
I know howto pick them, too.

383
00:44:18,167 --> 00:44:21,284
If James comes around,
will you tell him I'm looking for him?

384
00:44:21,407 --> 00:44:23,523
You bet.

385
00:44:23,647 --> 00:44:26,207
And Donna, you take it easy.

386
00:44:38,447 --> 00:44:42,326
That's the videotape we just saw,
the one we found in Laura's bedroom.

387
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:46,517
At a certain point, I'm going to want
to showthis to the boyfriend.

388
00:44:46,647 --> 00:44:48,524
You say when.

389
00:44:48,647 --> 00:44:52,435
- Did you complete your forensics?
- You bet. All done.

390
00:44:52,727 --> 00:44:55,525
- No key yet?
- We're still looking.

391
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:03,839
Why not?

392
00:45:09,567 --> 00:45:12,365
Diane, I've just opened
Laura Palmer's diary.

393
00:45:12,487 --> 00:45:17,322
This is the last entry,
dated February 23rd.

394
00:45:18,327 --> 00:45:22,798
It reads: "Asparagus for dinner again.
I hate asparagus.

395
00:45:24,687 --> 00:45:28,282
"Does this mean I'll never grow up?"
And then she's written:

396
00:45:28,407 --> 00:45:33,242
"Nervous about meeting 'J' tonight."
That's the letter 'J', Diane.

397
00:45:37,927 --> 00:45:41,840
And that is the last entry.
That's something to get started on.

398
00:45:42,247 --> 00:45:46,559
- Yeah, that's one out of 26.
- One out of 26.

399
00:45:48,327 --> 00:45:51,364
Diane, I've just turned back 18 days
to day one.

400
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:55,685
Taped to the page is a plastic envelope
containing a white residue

401
00:45:55,807 --> 00:45:58,196
and a key to a safety deposit box.

402
00:45:58,927 --> 00:46:03,284
Sheriff, we have to very carefully
remove this key.

403
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:06,366
We're going to run this envelope.

404
00:46:06,487 --> 00:46:10,605
My bet is it will test positive
for cocaine.

405
00:46:12,167 --> 00:46:15,637
- That's impossible.
- You ever been surprised before?

406
00:46:16,647 --> 00:46:20,526
Mr Cooper,
you didn't know Laura Palmer.

407
00:46:20,647 --> 00:46:23,957
Let's get a court order to open
the safety deposit box

408
00:46:24,087 --> 00:46:28,205
and maybe we'll both find out
a fewthings about Laura Palmer.

409
00:46:34,807 --> 00:46:37,879
Diane, I'm holding a small box
of chocolate bunnies.

410
00:46:46,127 --> 00:46:49,085
- Lucy.
- Andy, is that you?

411
00:46:49,367 --> 00:46:53,485
Tell Harry we found where...
it happened.

412
00:46:54,767 --> 00:46:58,680
Where Ronnette and Laura were taken
and tortured.

413
00:46:59,247 --> 00:47:01,203
Tell Harry...

414
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,756
...I didn't cry.

415
00:47:07,767 --> 00:47:12,602
Andy, are you OK?
Sweetie?

416
00:47:13,487 --> 00:47:15,364
But, Lucy...

417
00:47:17,567 --> 00:47:19,922
...it's so horrible.

418
00:47:21,767 --> 00:47:25,077
Andy, sweetie.

419
00:47:26,767 --> 00:47:28,644
My God.

420
00:47:39,207 --> 00:47:43,644
Bobby, you have been advised of your
constitutional rights. Am I correct?

421
00:47:43,767 --> 00:47:45,086
Yes.

422
00:47:46,807 --> 00:47:49,685
- Bobby, did you kill Laura Palmer?
- No!

423
00:47:50,327 --> 00:47:54,320
She was studying at your house
until about 9:30 last night?

424
00:47:54,887 --> 00:47:57,082
- Yeah.
- Bobby.

425
00:47:58,527 --> 00:47:59,721
Yes, sir.

426
00:48:00,927 --> 00:48:04,044
- Did she drive herself home?
- Yes.

427
00:48:04,687 --> 00:48:07,679
You two had a big fight last week,
didn't you?

428
00:48:07,807 --> 00:48:12,244
So what? If I had a fight with her,
if I sang songs with her,

429
00:48:12,367 --> 00:48:15,404
if I went skipping rope with her,
what difference does it make?

430
00:48:15,527 --> 00:48:17,119
I didn't kill her.

431
00:48:22,247 --> 00:48:25,000
Bobby, here's howthis works:

432
00:48:25,127 --> 00:48:29,643
we ask the questions and you answer
the questions that we ask,

433
00:48:29,767 --> 00:48:32,565
briefly and to the point.

434
00:48:51,007 --> 00:48:54,079
Did you shoot this video, Bobby?

435
00:48:57,687 --> 00:49:00,520
If you didn't, then who did?

436
00:49:01,327 --> 00:49:03,761
Did you know Laura was seeing
someone else?

437
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:07,520
That's what you fought about last week.

438
00:49:09,767 --> 00:49:13,965
Look at these pictures.
Look how happy she is.

439
00:49:18,967 --> 00:49:23,802
- You ever do cocaine with Laura, Bobby?
- I don't do drugs.

440
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:27,203
Excuse me, what are you charging
my client with?

441
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:33,638
That's right.

442
00:49:35,367 --> 00:49:38,996
You're a football player,
aren't you, Bobby?

443
00:49:40,127 --> 00:49:43,039
If you knew who she was seeing...

444
00:49:45,207 --> 00:49:47,163
...tell us.

445
00:49:47,287 --> 00:49:50,916
- Ask Donna, she was with her.
- I'm asking you.

446
00:49:53,367 --> 00:49:56,404
Come on, Bobby, give me a name.

447
00:49:56,527 --> 00:49:59,200
Here's a hint: first initial 'J'.

448
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,758
No...

449
00:50:17,607 --> 00:50:20,121
...she wouldn't do that to me.

450
00:50:22,407 --> 00:50:24,875
You didn't love her anyway.

451
00:50:25,687 --> 00:50:27,040
Let him go.

452
00:50:39,847 --> 00:50:43,635
Julie, the Norwegians are signing
the contract at four o'clock.

453
00:50:43,767 --> 00:50:45,405
When Mr Horne returns,

454
00:50:45,527 --> 00:50:49,315
make sure they do not hear
about Laura Palmer's death.

455
00:50:49,447 --> 00:50:52,837
That will blowthe whole deal.
Got it? Thank you.

456
00:50:54,007 --> 00:50:57,044
OK, Bob. OK, Bob.

457
00:51:00,327 --> 00:51:05,447
Julie, what would happen
if I pulled this out?

458
00:51:06,287 --> 00:51:08,323
You wouldn't.

459
00:51:12,967 --> 00:51:15,242
Audrey, look what you've done!

460
00:51:17,447 --> 00:51:20,007
Did they scoff the whole smorgasbord?

461
00:51:20,127 --> 00:51:22,641
- Audrey, don't go in there.
- I'm hungry.

462
00:51:22,767 --> 00:51:24,439
Don't go in there!

463
00:52:08,807 --> 00:52:12,766
Excuse me, is there something wrong,
young pretty girl?

464
00:52:14,687 --> 00:52:17,485
They found my friend Laura...

465
00:52:18,767 --> 00:52:21,964
lying face down on a rocky beach,

466
00:52:22,887 --> 00:52:25,162
completely naked.

467
00:52:27,047 --> 00:52:28,958
She'd been murdered.

468
00:52:51,207 --> 00:52:54,995
- Hey, buddy.
- Snake. We're out of here, man.

469
00:52:55,127 --> 00:52:57,960
Just a sec. Donna's still in there.

470
00:52:59,527 --> 00:53:03,361
- You straightened her out yet?
- I don't know what's up with her.

471
00:53:03,487 --> 00:53:07,560
Forget her.
I've got it figured. Laura and her.

472
00:53:08,527 --> 00:53:12,236
That cop mentioned
something about the letter 'J'.

473
00:53:12,527 --> 00:53:14,802
We're looking at some freaking biker

474
00:53:14,927 --> 00:53:18,886
and some freaking biker is going
to get his head busted open.

475
00:53:19,007 --> 00:53:22,158
What's his name?
We'll finish this quick.

476
00:53:30,967 --> 00:53:32,605
Come outside.

477
00:53:34,927 --> 00:53:39,079
Robert, I'll be home this evening
if you need a sympathetic ear.

478
00:53:39,927 --> 00:53:43,078
I don't need
any damn sympathetic anything.

479
00:53:45,647 --> 00:53:48,639
I have no idea
what's going on here.

480
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,803
Let's just go home.

481
00:53:52,727 --> 00:53:55,161
So you were on a picnic,
just the two of you?

482
00:53:55,287 --> 00:53:59,519
Way up in the mountains,
not another souI around?

483
00:54:00,407 --> 00:54:03,843
Is there some law
against having a picnic?

484
00:54:04,887 --> 00:54:09,677
Donna, this is interesting to me.
With just two of you out there,

485
00:54:09,807 --> 00:54:13,402
I can't figure out howthese pictures
got taken.

486
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,722
That's easy.

487
00:54:16,887 --> 00:54:19,924
There was this...

488
00:54:20,367 --> 00:54:23,404
hiker that came along,
a woman hiker.

489
00:54:23,527 --> 00:54:25,961
She had a backpack and...

490
00:54:28,167 --> 00:54:30,442
...we asked her to take the pictures
for us.

491
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:34,597
What was her name?

492
00:54:34,727 --> 00:54:37,082
I don't think we asked her.
I forgot.

493
00:54:43,127 --> 00:54:46,005
Donna, who are you protecting?

494
00:54:46,567 --> 00:54:48,683
Nobody, that's really what happened.

495
00:54:49,407 --> 00:54:52,797
Does this person's name
start with the letter 'J'?

496
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:57,079
- She didn't tell us her name.
- Donna, this is serious business.

497
00:54:58,527 --> 00:55:02,202
More serious than Laura falling in love
with someone other than her boyfriend.

498
00:55:02,327 --> 00:55:04,158
Much more serious.

499
00:55:04,287 --> 00:55:08,166
Agent Cooper,
the Sheriff's ready to roll up to the site

500
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:10,642
and I've got something else
for you here.

501
00:55:11,407 --> 00:55:13,716
You can come on in.

502
00:55:16,247 --> 00:55:19,239
I know Laura was your best friend.

503
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:25,156
You've been through a lot today.
We're finished for now.

504
00:55:42,407 --> 00:55:45,604
Go ahead, Lucy.
Tell Agent Cooper what you heard.

505
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:50,566
After Bobby was taken
back to his cell,

506
00:55:50,687 --> 00:55:54,680
his parents were standing
by the door with his lawyer.

507
00:55:54,807 --> 00:55:58,482
Bobby was released and he came out
and saw his friend Mike,

508
00:55:58,607 --> 00:56:01,758
who was down by the water cooler,
which is near my desk.

509
00:56:01,887 --> 00:56:07,166
I pretended to be typing, but I was typing
what Mike and Bobby were saying.

510
00:56:07,287 --> 00:56:10,484
They didn't say exactly who it was
they were talking about,

511
00:56:10,607 --> 00:56:13,917
but anyway here's
what they were saying.

512
00:56:14,047 --> 00:56:17,722
They said the person we're looking for
is a biker.

513
00:56:25,647 --> 00:56:27,797
Looks like a hog to me.

514
00:56:28,727 --> 00:56:32,356
- Holy smoke.
- Holy smoke!

515
00:56:58,127 --> 00:57:01,199
The Norwegians are leaving!

516
00:57:10,087 --> 00:57:12,078
The Norwegians are gone.

517
00:57:12,207 --> 00:57:15,916
Everyone here has gone. Not good.

518
00:57:16,047 --> 00:57:19,164
You are throwing away the investment
opportunity of a lifetime.

519
00:57:19,287 --> 00:57:22,597
- Better that than throw a lifetime away.
- You stay out of this!

520
00:58:11,927 --> 00:58:13,645
Sheriff.

521
00:58:14,767 --> 00:58:17,235
Diane, it's 4:10 pm
at the scene of the crime.

522
00:58:17,367 --> 00:58:19,403
Here's something we haven't seen before:

523
00:58:19,527 --> 00:58:21,677
a mound of dirt,
a foot and a half in diameter.

524
00:58:21,807 --> 00:58:24,605
On the top is a gold necklace
with a gold heart.

525
00:58:24,727 --> 00:58:27,480
Correction: half a gold heart.

526
00:58:27,607 --> 00:58:31,122
At the base of the mound of dirt
is a torn piece of newsprint

527
00:58:31,247 --> 00:58:34,205
written with the words,
which appear to be in blood,

528
00:58:34,327 --> 00:58:37,285
"Fire walk with me".

529
00:58:40,127 --> 00:58:44,564
Sheriff, you and I have got to find out
who's got the other half of that heart.

530
00:59:36,167 --> 00:59:37,885
Mrs Horne?

531
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:42,798
It might help
if you talked to Johnny yourself.

532
00:59:42,927 --> 00:59:45,839
So you think it might help?

533
00:59:46,287 --> 00:59:48,437
You can tell Johnny one more time

534
00:59:48,567 --> 00:59:52,082
that Laura isn't coming this afternoon
to work with him.

535
00:59:52,287 --> 00:59:55,518
Or tomorrow afternoon
or any afternoon.

536
00:59:55,647 --> 00:59:59,037
What is so difficult
to understand about that?

537
01:00:13,487 --> 01:00:15,523
It fell down.

538
01:00:17,007 --> 01:00:20,443
I knew Laura.
She was always so nice.

539
01:00:20,567 --> 01:00:22,762
When was the last time she came in?

540
01:00:22,887 --> 01:00:26,800
I couldn't tell you exactly.
We have so many box es.

541
01:00:26,927 --> 01:00:30,124
- You don't keep records?
- We have plenty of paperwork.

542
01:00:30,247 --> 01:00:32,556
How long has she had
this box?

543
01:00:32,687 --> 01:00:36,521
I'd say about six months.
I could check for you.

544
01:00:36,647 --> 01:00:39,878
Would you, please?
And close the door on the way out.

545
01:00:52,287 --> 01:00:54,198
"Flesh World".

546
01:00:54,447 --> 01:00:56,119
Man!

547
01:01:04,887 --> 01:01:10,007
There's over 10,000 dollars here.
That's a lot of girl scout cookies.

548
01:01:15,567 --> 01:01:18,127
Here's a page that's marked.

549
01:01:22,327 --> 01:01:25,444
There's your connection:
Ronnette Pulaski.

550
01:01:26,807 --> 01:01:28,399
I can't believe it.

551
01:01:37,367 --> 01:01:42,566
...the law enforcement officials
emerging from an abandoned railway car...

552
01:01:43,447 --> 01:01:45,836
Shelly, would you turn
the television off?

553
01:01:46,567 --> 01:01:49,127
Why, Leo? I want to see this.

554
01:01:49,967 --> 01:01:51,559
Shelly, turn it off.

555
01:01:51,687 --> 01:01:53,996
...escaped her captor and fled to safety,

556
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:57,039
remains hospitalised
in critical condition...

557
01:01:59,207 --> 01:02:02,324
Shelly, sit down here a minute
and help me out.

558
01:02:08,367 --> 01:02:11,086
What kind of cigarettes do you smoke?

559
01:02:11,527 --> 01:02:13,199
Whatever's around.

560
01:02:13,327 --> 01:02:17,445
No, you don't. You smoke these.
What are these doing here?

561
01:02:18,567 --> 01:02:22,480
I pick up different packs from the diner
all the time, me and Norma.

562
01:02:22,607 --> 01:02:24,245
Two things, Shelly.

563
01:02:24,367 --> 01:02:27,882
When I come home, this house
should be clean and I mean clean.

564
01:02:28,007 --> 01:02:30,316
You smoke one brand of cigarettes
from now on.

565
01:02:30,447 --> 01:02:33,120
If I ever see two brands
of cigarettes again,

566
01:02:33,247 --> 01:02:36,159
I'm going to snap your neck
like a twig.

567
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:38,562
You have nothing to worry
about with me, darling.

568
01:02:38,687 --> 01:02:40,484
That's right.

569
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:54,604
Big Ed's Gas Farm.
Ed speaking.

570
01:02:54,727 --> 01:02:57,924
I'm sorry. I know I promised
not to call you there,

571
01:02:58,447 --> 01:03:00,597
but I have to see you.

572
01:03:01,447 --> 01:03:04,200
- I hurt so bad.
- It's OK.

573
01:03:07,047 --> 01:03:10,562
Why don't I meet you
at the Roadhouse around 9:30?

574
01:03:11,007 --> 01:03:14,477
Thank you, Ed.
I'll see you tonight.

575
01:03:14,607 --> 01:03:16,996
All right, sweetheart.

576
01:03:35,047 --> 01:03:38,835
- I think I saw a cottontail rabbit.
- Must have been a snowshoe rabbit.

577
01:03:38,967 --> 01:03:42,846
Snowshoe?
Snowshoe rabbit?

578
01:03:48,167 --> 01:03:49,998
Who's the babe?

579
01:03:50,127 --> 01:03:54,245
That is one of the most beautiful women
in the state. Mrs Packard.

580
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:56,483
Packard Sawmill?

581
01:03:57,127 --> 01:04:00,358
- Where's Mr Packard?
- Died in a boating accident.

582
01:04:00,487 --> 01:04:04,480
Andrew Packard practically built this
town. Brought her over from Hong Kong.

583
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:08,646
Left her everything,
which didn't exactly please his sister.

584
01:04:08,767 --> 01:04:11,600
That's her, the original deep freeze.

585
01:04:11,727 --> 01:04:13,604
Who's the glad-handing dandy?

586
01:04:14,407 --> 01:04:17,956
Benjamin Horne, local big-wig.
He owns half the town.

587
01:04:18,087 --> 01:04:20,521
He's not after her.
He's after her land.

588
01:04:27,327 --> 01:04:30,797
- Who's the lady with the log?
- We call her the Log Lady.

589
01:04:38,527 --> 01:04:43,442
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I could have your attention.

590
01:04:46,967 --> 01:04:48,878
Is this thing on?

591
01:04:49,007 --> 01:04:51,043
- Is this thing on?
- Hang on, Dwayne.

592
01:04:55,567 --> 01:04:57,956
Thank you, Mayor Milford.

593
01:04:58,687 --> 01:04:59,802
Agent Cooper.

594
01:05:04,407 --> 01:05:06,398
Thank you, Sheriff.

595
01:05:06,727 --> 01:05:10,561
Ladies and gentlemen,
FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper.

596
01:05:11,687 --> 01:05:15,475
One year ago, in a town
in the south-west corner of this state,

597
01:05:15,607 --> 01:05:18,883
the body of a young girl
named Teresa Banks was found.

598
01:05:19,007 --> 01:05:22,443
She had no family.
No one came forward to claim her body.

599
01:05:22,567 --> 01:05:25,957
It wasn't even news...until today.

600
01:05:26,367 --> 01:05:30,485
There are irrefutable similarities,
which I cannot discuss,

601
01:05:30,607 --> 01:05:33,326
that lead us to conclude
Laura Palmer was the second

602
01:05:33,447 --> 01:05:37,884
and Ronnette Pulaski would have been
the third victim of the same killer.

603
01:05:38,887 --> 01:05:41,959
There is a chance the person
who committed these crimes

604
01:05:42,087 --> 01:05:46,478
is someone from this town,
possibly even someone you know.

605
01:05:47,327 --> 01:05:51,957
It is vitally important
that this not turn into a witch hunt.

606
01:05:52,087 --> 01:05:56,922
I would suggest a temporary curfew
for those under eighteen years of age.

607
01:05:57,927 --> 01:06:01,044
Keeping your kids off the streets now
may teach them caution

608
01:06:01,167 --> 01:06:04,637
that may protect them in the days
and weeks to come.

609
01:06:04,767 --> 01:06:08,885
I will remind you that these crimes
occurred at night.

610
01:06:25,527 --> 01:06:28,564
When I left the house,
Sarah was sleeping.

611
01:06:28,687 --> 01:06:31,599
Leland made it through the day
somehow.

612
01:06:31,727 --> 01:06:34,082
I'm not sure I could have done
the same.

613
01:06:34,207 --> 01:06:36,801
Poor dear, poor Sarah.

614
01:06:37,807 --> 01:06:42,756
Eileen, the brutality...the madness of it.

615
01:06:43,687 --> 01:06:45,598
I know.

616
01:06:45,967 --> 01:06:50,358
They're not releasing many details.
Wisely, I suppose.

617
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:55,837
At the scene where it happened,
no one else knows this,

618
01:06:55,967 --> 01:06:58,117
they found part of a necklace,

619
01:06:58,247 --> 01:07:00,807
half of a golden heart.

620
01:07:00,927 --> 01:07:03,282
It was Laura's.

621
01:07:03,607 --> 01:07:08,635
They know this because she was wearing
it in a video of a picnic they found.

622
01:07:09,767 --> 01:07:13,806
I'm telling you this because Donna
was in the video with her.

623
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:18,281
She won't tell them who shot it
or who else was with them,

624
01:07:18,767 --> 01:07:23,204
but they think the killer may have
the other half of the heart.

625
01:07:34,687 --> 01:07:38,077
Donna, which do you like better?

626
01:07:38,927 --> 01:07:41,725
"The blossom of the evening"

627
01:07:41,847 --> 01:07:45,601
or "The full flower of the evening"?

628
01:07:47,527 --> 01:07:50,200
Listen to me, this is serious.

629
01:07:50,447 --> 01:07:52,517
This is serious, too.

630
01:07:53,327 --> 01:07:56,637
I'm going out the window
and I need you to cover for me.

631
01:07:56,767 --> 01:08:00,123
Don't you know there's a curfew?
They announced it on the radio.

632
01:08:00,247 --> 01:08:03,762
I know, Einstein.
That's why I need you to cover for me.

633
01:08:03,887 --> 01:08:07,118
I suppose this will include
a phone conversation with Mike,

634
01:08:07,247 --> 01:08:10,000
Mr Bonehead Boyfriend?

635
01:08:10,447 --> 01:08:14,759
No, this is about Laura
and it's really serious.

636
01:08:17,207 --> 01:08:18,799
Check.

637
01:08:20,807 --> 01:08:22,718
Thank you.

638
01:08:40,287 --> 01:08:44,360
- I'll need to borrow your bike.
- Then, pump some air in the back tyre.

639
01:08:45,007 --> 01:08:48,079
Yeah. Harriet, don't forget
to brush your teeth.

640
01:08:53,607 --> 01:08:55,518
Actually,

641
01:08:57,287 --> 01:08:59,847
now that some time has passed,

642
01:09:01,287 --> 01:09:04,563
I like
"The full blossom of the evening".

643
01:09:13,327 --> 01:09:14,760
Hey, Snake.

644
01:09:15,567 --> 01:09:18,764
Don't take any oink oink
off that pretty pig.

645
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:21,796
Don't you worry about that.

646
01:09:33,407 --> 01:09:36,160
Hi, Doctor Hayward.
I'd like to talk to Donna.

647
01:09:36,287 --> 01:09:39,359
Donna's upstairs
getting ready for bed, Mike.

648
01:09:41,807 --> 01:09:44,446
You're not drinking and driving,
are you?

649
01:09:44,567 --> 01:09:48,116
We're all pretty broken up
about what happened today, sir.

650
01:09:48,247 --> 01:09:51,125
Besides,
Bobby's doing most of the driving.

651
01:09:52,287 --> 01:09:54,755
I'll see if she wants to come down.

652
01:09:54,887 --> 01:09:57,685
Would you mind
waiting out here, please?

653
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:07,920
The best-laid plans of mice and men.

654
01:10:10,887 --> 01:10:12,445
Snake, let's go!

655
01:10:30,647 --> 01:10:32,797
Where's your sister?

656
01:10:32,967 --> 01:10:38,041
Dad, I'm going to tell it to you
and I'm going to tell it to you straight.

657
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:39,885
Harriet!

658
01:10:41,287 --> 01:10:43,437
See that window?

659
01:10:44,327 --> 01:10:46,124
Later.

660
01:10:51,487 --> 01:10:55,082
- Donna's not here.
- You mean she snuck out?

661
01:10:55,207 --> 01:10:58,119
Mike, maybe you have an idea
where she might have gone.

662
01:10:59,167 --> 01:11:01,681
Oh, we'll find her.
Don't you worry about that.

663
01:11:05,847 --> 01:11:07,439
Roadhouse.

664
01:11:09,087 --> 01:11:10,600
Let's go!

665
01:11:19,967 --> 01:11:22,686
Sheriff, I've got a call for you
from Dr Hayward.

666
01:11:22,807 --> 01:11:25,526
I explained that you're on a stake-out
at the Roadhouse,

667
01:11:25,647 --> 01:11:28,844
but he still would very much
like to talk to you.

668
01:11:28,967 --> 01:11:30,480
Patch him through.

669
01:11:30,607 --> 01:11:34,043
I'm going to patch him
through to you now, Sheriff.

670
01:11:35,727 --> 01:11:38,844
I'm patching you through now,
Dr Hayward.

671
01:11:39,527 --> 01:11:42,280
Harry, my daughter Donna
snuck out of the house.

672
01:11:42,407 --> 01:11:44,045
I don't know where she's gone.

673
01:11:44,167 --> 01:11:49,116
Doc, you rest easy now.
I'm going to put out an all points for her.

674
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:52,478
- We'll keep our eyes peeled.
- Thanks, Harry.

675
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:55,760
You betcha.

676
01:11:55,887 --> 01:11:59,926
- Lucy, you take care of that all points now.
- All right, Sheriff.

677
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:03,804
- Of course Donna snuck out.
- Meaning what?

678
01:12:03,927 --> 01:12:07,078
How else is she going to lead us
to that biker?

679
01:12:24,767 --> 01:12:27,804
So all afternoon I've been hanging
drapes.

680
01:12:28,127 --> 01:12:30,163
- Drapes?
- Drapes.

681
01:12:31,407 --> 01:12:33,398
Lots of them.

682
01:12:33,927 --> 01:12:38,000
You know how I feel about you, Ed.
Don't do it for me, do it for yourself.

683
01:12:39,287 --> 01:12:42,120
- It's Tammy Wynette time, darling.
- Yeah?

684
01:12:43,247 --> 01:12:46,603
- What about you and Hank?
- I told you.

685
01:12:48,167 --> 01:12:51,637
- I'm going to leave Hank.
- Before or after he gets parole?

686
01:12:56,247 --> 01:13:00,365
I love you, Ed.
I'll do what's best for both of us.

687
01:13:01,887 --> 01:13:05,038
When your sweetheart's husband's
in the joint for manslaughter,

688
01:13:05,167 --> 01:13:08,045
the word "parole"
has a nasty ring to it.

689
01:13:28,367 --> 01:13:30,198
You know why I'm whittling?

690
01:13:30,327 --> 01:13:34,161
OK, I'll bite again.
Why are you whittling?

691
01:13:34,287 --> 01:13:36,084
That's what you do in a town

692
01:13:36,207 --> 01:13:39,961
where a yellow light still means
slow down, not speed up.

693
01:13:47,647 --> 01:13:49,365
Mike and Bobby.

694
01:13:50,207 --> 01:13:53,324
There's liable to be a little trouble
this evening.

695
01:14:29,087 --> 01:14:32,477
Scottie, Mutt and Jeff just crawled in.

696
01:14:35,927 --> 01:14:38,395
Oh, what a wonderful world!

697
01:14:43,087 --> 01:14:45,521
Looks like sooner than later.

698
01:14:49,607 --> 01:14:54,761
- Why don't you whistle for a little backup?
- I see which way the wind's blowing.

699
01:14:54,887 --> 01:14:59,085
Lucy, get us a backup unit at the
Roadhouse right away. Make that two.

700
01:14:59,207 --> 01:15:03,041
And call Dr Hayward. Tell him we've found
his daughter and she's fine.

701
01:15:03,167 --> 01:15:04,680
All right, Sheriff.

702
01:15:19,847 --> 01:15:21,405
Donna!

703
01:15:22,007 --> 01:15:25,204
Why are you sneaking around?
Everybody's looking for you.

704
01:15:32,687 --> 01:15:35,406
Get your hands off me.
Leave me alone!

705
01:15:35,527 --> 01:15:37,006
Get your hands off me!

706
01:15:37,127 --> 01:15:40,119
- Get your hands off me. Let go of me.
- No!

707
01:15:40,247 --> 01:15:42,078
That's enough!

708
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:45,119
You heard him. Let me go!

709
01:15:46,207 --> 01:15:48,641
Like that, Mr Monkey Wrench?

710
01:15:57,047 --> 01:16:00,517
You guys got it covered?
Don't worry, I'll take you to James.

711
01:16:08,047 --> 01:16:10,515
Joey Paulsen. That's a 'J'.

712
01:16:10,767 --> 01:16:13,076
No, he's taking her to somebody else.

713
01:16:13,207 --> 01:16:16,165
You want me to follow them
at a discreet distance?

714
01:16:16,727 --> 01:16:18,638
Harry, you're all right.

715
01:16:45,687 --> 01:16:47,325
Hold on!

716
01:16:48,367 --> 01:16:53,316
- Do you think they spotted us?
- Give me a doughnut.

717
01:17:11,087 --> 01:17:13,681
Well, Harry, I think we lost them.

718
01:17:15,727 --> 01:17:20,721
Man, smell those trees!
Smell those Douglas firs.

719
01:17:21,287 --> 01:17:23,357
I think I hear them.

720
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:27,246
- What's down there?
- An old logging road.

721
01:17:27,367 --> 01:17:30,996
The only access is five miles back
at the Packard mill.

722
01:17:31,567 --> 01:17:33,717
I told Doc Hayward
his daughter was OK.

723
01:17:33,847 --> 01:17:35,121
My fault, Harry.

724
01:17:35,247 --> 01:17:38,080
- Thanks, Joe.
- Good luck, James.

725
01:17:59,327 --> 01:18:02,364
James, they're looking for you.

726
01:18:02,487 --> 01:18:04,478
I'm going to talk to them,

727
01:18:04,607 --> 01:18:06,837
but I think they're going to lock me up.

728
01:18:06,967 --> 01:18:08,286
Why?

729
01:18:09,287 --> 01:18:12,165
I don't have an alibi for last night.
I was with her.

730
01:18:12,287 --> 01:18:17,315
- James, what happened last night?
- It was kinda like a nightmare.

731
01:18:17,447 --> 01:18:21,440
- Donna, she was a different person.
- What are you saying?

732
01:18:22,087 --> 01:18:25,045
I'm telling you, there were things
she was involved with,

733
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:29,604
things she let herself get pulled into,
things she thought you'd hate her for.

734
01:18:29,727 --> 01:18:31,797
She said, "There are things about me..."

735
01:18:31,927 --> 01:18:34,725
She said, "Even Donna doesn't know me."

736
01:18:35,607 --> 01:18:39,725
I knew her. I knew her better
than she thought I did.

737
01:18:39,887 --> 01:18:43,641
Donna, she said something
about a guy getting killed.

738
01:18:44,407 --> 01:18:46,477
- Who?
- She didn't say.

739
01:18:47,087 --> 01:18:53,276
But she said Bobby told her
that he killed this guy.

740
01:18:54,527 --> 01:18:56,404
Oh, my God.

741
01:18:56,567 --> 01:18:59,365
This is why I had to see you.

742
01:19:00,247 --> 01:19:04,877
It all makes some kind of terrible sense
that she died, that someone killed her.

743
01:19:05,007 --> 01:19:07,680
I don't know. I can't explain it.

744
01:19:07,807 --> 01:19:10,116
I didn't know
whether to believe any of this last night.

745
01:19:10,247 --> 01:19:13,796
I mean, half the time
she wasn't making any sense.

746
01:19:13,927 --> 01:19:17,556
I couldn't calm her down.
I could hardly keep her on the bike.

747
01:19:17,687 --> 01:19:21,202
We came to the light at Sparkwood and 21,

748
01:19:21,327 --> 01:19:26,447
and she... she put her hands
around my neck

749
01:19:28,487 --> 01:19:33,083
and she screamed she loved me.

750
01:19:35,127 --> 01:19:37,243
I looked into her eyes. They were clear.

751
01:19:37,367 --> 01:19:40,325
It was like she was Laura again.

752
01:19:40,447 --> 01:19:44,440
She was so sad.
She sounded so desperate.

753
01:19:46,327 --> 01:19:50,081
Then she ran off.
I let her go and she died.

754
01:19:50,687 --> 01:19:52,564
It's OK.

755
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:56,961
It's not your fault, James.

756
01:19:58,767 --> 01:20:00,678
It's OK.

757
01:20:01,727 --> 01:20:05,083
James. It's all right, James.

758
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:20,365
Oh, my God.

759
01:20:21,287 --> 01:20:22,561
I'm sorry.

760
01:20:25,007 --> 01:20:26,963
Oh, my God.

761
01:20:30,087 --> 01:20:33,762
I changed my mind. I'm not sorry.

762
01:20:49,647 --> 01:20:51,444
James.

763
01:20:55,447 --> 01:20:57,244
James.

764
01:21:01,447 --> 01:21:06,646
Oh, James. Those are sirens.

765
01:21:09,047 --> 01:21:13,518
I've got to go to the police.
I don't have an alibi.

766
01:21:14,487 --> 01:21:16,921
After she left I just rode around.

767
01:21:17,047 --> 01:21:20,244
The necklace you gave Laura
with the golden heart.

768
01:21:20,367 --> 01:21:23,439
- You have to give me the other half.
- Why?

769
01:21:23,567 --> 01:21:27,526
They found the half where she was killed
and think the killer has the other half.

770
01:21:27,647 --> 01:21:30,320
If you go there
with the necklace and no alibi...

771
01:21:30,447 --> 01:21:32,563
- What about you?
- I'll get rid of it.

772
01:21:32,687 --> 01:21:34,757
- No.
- We'll hide it.

773
01:21:35,287 --> 01:21:39,280
- All right. We'll bury it.
- OK.

774
01:21:40,687 --> 01:21:43,520
- Right here.
- OK.

775
01:22:15,007 --> 01:22:16,918
I'll take you home.

776
01:22:39,007 --> 01:22:41,805
- What goes around comes around.
- Round and round.

777
01:23:02,167 --> 01:23:04,522
That's not Joey, that's James Hurley.

778
01:23:04,647 --> 01:23:08,640
James, stand away from the bike.
Stand away from the girl.

779
01:23:08,767 --> 01:23:12,237
- Put your hands behind your head.
- He didn't do anything!

780
01:23:12,647 --> 01:23:14,842
She's probably right.

781
01:23:19,527 --> 01:23:22,360
James.
He didn't do anything.

782
01:23:26,247 --> 01:23:28,602
Lucy, get an arrest form ready.

783
01:23:31,127 --> 01:23:33,004
Doc, I'm releasing her to you,

784
01:23:33,127 --> 01:23:36,085
but I want her back for questioning
in the morning.

785
01:23:36,207 --> 01:23:38,118
- All right, Harry.
- Andy, Hawk.

786
01:23:38,247 --> 01:23:41,080
Put James back in number four.

787
01:23:45,807 --> 01:23:46,956
James.

788
01:23:47,727 --> 01:23:50,116
It's gonna be all right.

789
01:24:03,487 --> 01:24:05,284
You!

790
01:24:15,687 --> 01:24:17,643
We'll check on you later.

791
01:24:23,927 --> 01:24:26,236
Good night, officers.

792
01:24:45,407 --> 01:24:47,398
I'm sorry, Dad.

793
01:24:49,887 --> 01:24:52,924
Donna, after what happened today,

794
01:24:53,047 --> 01:24:57,677
I'm sure you understand what you put
your mother and me through tonight.

795
01:24:58,887 --> 01:25:04,245
But I know you wouldn't have done it
unless you had a good reason.

796
01:25:07,487 --> 01:25:11,116
We also have another problem
facing us, young lady.

797
01:25:12,847 --> 01:25:15,600
Where's your sister's bicycle?

798
01:25:16,407 --> 01:25:19,001
I left it at the Roadhouse.

799
01:25:19,407 --> 01:25:21,841
We'll have to go get it.

800
01:25:23,367 --> 01:25:28,236
I understand you promised Harriet
you'd put some air in the back tyre.

801
01:25:28,927 --> 01:25:30,918
Yes, I did.

802
01:25:33,087 --> 01:25:36,682
We're so thankful
to have a daughter like you.

803
01:25:44,087 --> 01:25:46,362
A policeman's dream!

804
01:25:46,687 --> 01:25:50,441
Yup, Lucy sets it up for us every night.

805
01:25:50,567 --> 01:25:52,000
Is everything OK?

806
01:25:52,127 --> 01:25:56,325
There's extra jelly doughnuts for Agent
Cooper and there's some extra decaf.

807
01:25:56,447 --> 01:26:00,360
You know, Andy's been drinking
so much caffeinated coffee lately.

808
01:26:00,487 --> 01:26:05,083
Thank you, Lucy. You can go
back to work now and no listening.

809
01:26:05,567 --> 01:26:07,842
Sheriff, that reminds me.

810
01:26:08,367 --> 01:26:12,155
Can you recommend
a good, inexpensive hotel or motel?

811
01:26:12,287 --> 01:26:14,721
It doesn't have to be fancy.

812
01:26:14,847 --> 01:26:17,281
I can get you a good rate
up at the Great Northern.

813
01:26:17,407 --> 01:26:19,921
I think I'm going to be here
for some time.

814
01:26:20,047 --> 01:26:22,880
These motels promise you a good rate,

815
01:26:23,007 --> 01:26:25,157
but when you get there
it's a different story.

816
01:26:25,287 --> 01:26:29,280
All I need is a bed,
a bathroom, a telephone,

817
01:26:29,487 --> 01:26:34,038
and sometimes a television, in the event
I get a chance to knock off early.

818
01:26:34,167 --> 01:26:37,398
I can get you a good rate
up at the Great Northern.

819
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:39,285
Sold.

820
01:26:39,407 --> 01:26:42,080
Well, tomorrow comes early.

821
01:26:46,887 --> 01:26:49,481
Diane, it's 12:28 am.

822
01:26:49,607 --> 01:26:52,599
I'll be staying locally
at the Great Northern Hotel.

823
01:26:52,727 --> 01:26:55,116
Sheriff's getting me a rate.

824
01:26:58,607 --> 01:27:01,041
When you least expect it.

825
01:27:37,407 --> 01:27:39,125
Hello, Sheriff.

826
01:27:41,087 --> 01:27:42,884
Hey, Jo.

827
01:27:43,527 --> 01:27:47,202
I understand you wanted to see
the Sheriff up here.

828
01:27:47,327 --> 01:27:49,238
Yes, I did.

829
01:27:51,527 --> 01:27:53,563
Right over here.

830
01:28:04,567 --> 01:28:06,558
He's here again.

831
01:28:06,727 --> 01:28:10,083
Let's get together and talk about it.

832
01:28:10,847 --> 01:28:12,439
All right.

833
01:28:22,527 --> 01:28:24,165
All right.

834
01:28:30,687 --> 01:28:35,397
It must have happened about this time
24 hours ago.

835
01:28:38,407 --> 01:28:39,999
I'm afraid.
